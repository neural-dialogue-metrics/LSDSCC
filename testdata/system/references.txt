You can partion the HD with gparted from the live cd , then start the installer .. perhaps . __eou__ thats how i tend to do it . __eou__ The installers partion manager tool is a bit . annoying . __eou__ I also noticed the installer did not have a ' Install to a specific drive using the whold drive ' option .. __eou__ sort of annoying it will automate other things .. but not a fairly common case of a Seperate HD Just for linux . __eou__
I connect using the same user that I log into when I boot up . __eou__ ^^ __eou__
I realize that .. what I am asking for is a program to help me manage the power better .. not magically generate power __eou__
ah lame . I have not had an issues with my version . Although I think I am running an unstable chrome ..... checking my details __eou__ ah nope , im running stable come . and iced tea 6 . So I guess you could try switching down a version . 7 might just suck __eou__
Can you use VNC clients over different **unknown** ? Like if I wanted to control my Ubuntu distro from say my Win8 or Lubuntu distro ? ( VNC noob ) __eou__
Awesome . Any major differences between the two if I'm only using them to keep a persistent session ? __eou__
no idea , out of my league __eou__ this looks like it may tell you though http://guilleml.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/nvidia-powermizer-on-linux/ __eou__
so there 's no restart ? __eou__
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1549847 __eou__ no problem you can boot the iso from grub __eou__
cool . :) __eou__
but my connection is too slow to download from my ubuntu __eou__
so i type tar zxvf compat-wireless* into terminal ? __eou__
That depends on your hardware and kernel . The Ubuntu guys can help you with that . __eou__
So I would put a shared-network group with the subnets I want in there , excluding the one it is attached to ? __eou__
thanks for trying to help -- i don't have the keyboard skills to pastebin from terminal without a mouse __eou__
Can you use something like " mount -t xfs /dev/sdc2 **unknown** " ? __eou__
oh whoops , wine 1.4 __eou__
I read the sdb as sda :p __eou__ Maybe the BIOS has boot-sector protection enabled ? That would prevent GRUB from updating the Windows MBR __eou__ Everything else in sda5 looks good __eou__
look with fdisk -l __eou__
killall soffice . bin __eou__ That worked to kill mine had to google it . ;) __eou__
well whenever i click on a running app , it doesnt bring the app up , i dont know why __eou__
you mention it trying luck as his best option , which it isn't __eou__
try this command if it does not error run the last one again . sudo dpkg -- configure -a __eou__
yup , you are right __eou__ it 's ubuntu dude , i see all kind of strange things happening here , lol __eou__
your in cool . ;) __eou__
I admire your patience , skills and guts . __eou__
except for a flash upgrade failing to complete properly ( **unknown** , though maybe this is off thread as I've not been foloowing __eou__
last night for me . In my case , uname -r shows I'm running 3.2 . 0.26 but the module for that isn't being built " It is likely that 3.2 . **unknown** belongs to a chroot 's host " __eou__ so maybe worth sudo apt-get -- reinstall install nvidia-current && uname -r to see if its the same for you __eou__
yep __eou__ worked before though just fine ... __eou__ I think this all started with trying to upgrade to the newer nvidia driver ... __eou__
no ! just hanging around avoiding sleep :p __eou__
Is there a cheat sheet for this ? Lol because I can't remember shortcuts easily . __eou__
yep , and if you're quick , you'll begin to learn a little about all the software that turns arithmetic into a grahical interface . __eou__
" sudo apt-get update " if you still have missing , i'm guessing your mixing repos , or using a ppa or something __eou__
Hmmm , sounds like you have an unsolvable problem __eou__
That may be your method but not ever suggested here or in wikis , and has the chance of breaking the disc table if done incorrectly . __eou__
that is nit all your repos __eou__ np __eou__
that did not work unfortunately __eou__ any other ideas ? __eou__ speaker-test -c 2 -t wav *plays* sound when i am root , is completely silent when i am non-root __eou__

well at the very least do you know which on has better support . I hear currently nvidia has better drivers upport BUT AMD is **unknown** provide **unknown** drivers ? __eou__

i have never seens an **unknown** bing 32 bit __eou__
okay .. thanks :) __eou__
from email accaunt with pop3 to my local mail server witch has maildir format __eou__
I think it would be that the driver couldn't determine the optimum mode from what the display told it __eou__
syslogs last line is " frequency initialized - **unknown** PPM from **unknown** . drift " is that normal ? __eou__
CellTech llutz OK ... that dependency is for 32-bit systems only ... I'm using 64-bit __eou__
Thanks for the info . :-) __eou__
probably ... but for testing , a USB device would do fine . __eou__ you means a web control panel ? I've used webmin/virtualmin/usermin for years with great success . __eou__
Thank you very much for your help . I appreciate it . __eou__
It was a clean install working at 1920 as a wide screen display without problems then after a reboot it is running 1280x1040 and says it is a laptop . __eou__
Further , if you have not done soe make yourself familiar with methods to boot into CLI mode . __eou__ Sure , it is your decision as you are the root admin . __eou__
ill take a look , thanks __eou__
ntp re-install won't fix things . If your computer is always on ( or is on more than it is off) , you need NTP server installed to keep time synced to a reliable time source . This is because of drift , and the fact that ntpdate only changes the clock on boot __eou__
ok . The setup required would need to have it configured in a configuration file however since Puppet is being used . Would prefer not to change the Puppet uses to install packages ( apt-get -q -y -o Dpkg :: Options :: = -- **unknown** install < package > " __eou__ true . So far we've managed to avoid signing it for other distributions for simplicity . But maybe we'll need to rethink our current setup and use GPG signing __eou__
Yes , it 's the main user of those facilities __eou__
i want to copy from a linux to windows __eou__ the windows ip is 10.0 . **unknown** and the user is eli __eou__
this might clue you on which one : " document . **unknown** " Enter the guest access password to access the Internet . Ask the owner if you don't know the password . The guest access password can be found using Cisco Connect ." ) " __eou__
if you can ssh you should be able to scp too ! __eou__
that 's a pain :( __eou__
No , i mean the config files in /etc . It 's managed to mess up the dovecot config this time . Silly of me to do an update I guess - usually never update servers after install as I know ubuntu is pretty bad for this ... __eou__
ah ok __eou__
unlikely , since S99 runs after S05 __eou__
3rd party repo ? PPA ? what is it __eou__
you need ssh-server on the host you want to connect to __eou__ in your case , the windows-machine __eou__ or use putty/pscp from windows to **unknown** the file from the **unknown** __eou__

Where else are you going to shove a copy of your working RAM ? __eou__
yea , i see ... seems a shame to give that much away , but , if I want hibernation then its necessary __eou__
Just make it the same size as your RAM , plus a little bit . __eou__
the . xsession-errors were created by your blackbox . You need to create . xinitrc or . xsession yourself . I need to know if it is 102 MB aor 1024 MB ? **unknown** ? __eou__
Can you follow instructions like : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java#Oracle_.28Sun.29_Java_6 ? __eou__
if you want to upload it via phpmyadmin , do note that it is not the general php file you should look into but the one used by the apache module , which ( from memory ) usually is set at something like 8mb __eou__

- when it turns out to be easy , yes __eou__ - try it __eou__

php often has a limit on the size of files it will accept , to prevent denials of service __eou__
dd isn't good on a running system since files can change __eou__
I allready got that idea , but i really like to solve it properly __eou__ or do I have to reinstall linux ? __eou__
I'm on a 64-bit installation ; the trpex is ELF is 32-bit - it runs fine __eou__ No . That 's what multi-lib is for __eou__ It 's installed by default __eou__ Looks like a ' noexec ' issue to me with the error msg from bash __eou__ You've noticed that too ? Treating people like idiots ... breed unaware idiots to my mind ! __eou__

Ahhh , the colour choices can get a bit over the top sometimes __eou__

there are many tweaks not yet available , but that are just starting to be provided . Unity is too new yet __eou__
Let 's think . You've changed the ALSA config but pulseaudio is the sound server , so some interaction has occured __eou__

I havn't had much luck with it , but that was a while ago ( 2 years ) __eou__
been a while since I tried , that 's all __eou__
Ahh , good point . So we need to make sure the updated matching version of the 64-bit package is there first .... __eou__ So , do the " dpkg -r " step and let me know if that is successful , then we can get the 64-bit package sorted out __eou__
I'm trying to boot from a live usb stick __eou__

well , I'm not sure what is the name of the installer on xubuntu , maybe try a xubuntu channel or a xfce channel and they might have more ideas . What I think is that the problem is the package for the xfce installer has it 's own settings for **unknown** , but I'm not sure what is the name of the installer . __eou__
Could you open a terminal and type " sudo lshw ", then paste the output in a pastebin ? __eou__ OK , run this specific command : " lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4 ". What I need are ( 1 ) the precise card model ( it should look like " **unknown** " ) and the PCI ID of the card ( should look like " [ 14e4 : **unknown** " ) . ( xxxx are letters and/or numbers) . __eou__ Have you access on a second computer near you ? It would be extremely useful to chat on one system and try to solve the problem on the one you are currently on . __eou__ Otherwise , I can just tell you if your card is supported or not and give you the steps to solve the problem , but I won't be able to help in case it does not work __eou__ Just a minute , I'll search if there 's another way to check the model without rebooting to Ubuntu __eou__ OK , to get the hardware ID open Computer Management , then open the Device Manager , right-click on your wireless card and choose Properties , in the Advanced tab there should be a dropdown list , choose " Hardware ID " from that and copy and paste the contents displayed below ( I'm going from memory , might not be 100% accurate ) __eou__

maybe it 's installed but you just don't have anything in your path , if you find where it has been installed you'll just have to create a symlink to it in one of your PATH folder I guess __eou__
5 means : r-x __eou__ 4 means rw __eou__
Okay . __eou__
which part are you questioning ? :) __eou__
i will using it with -a and don't run it with sudo thanks __eou__

that will be very helpful ... __eou__
what will be the solution ? __eou__
That 's the safest I think ; it 's not something to do lightly though ... better to backup the configuration and start afresh for a production server . What 's wrong with using Debian on a VPS anyhow ? __eou__

i dual boot , but vms are awesome too __eou__ i wouldn't trust a windows installer __eou__ linux was never meant to be installed through windows , it 's just very kludgy __eou__
it looks like grub devs better get a handle this if we're going to see more and more pcs with GPT tables __eou__
I assumed that it dropped you to grub rescue prompt __eou__
You can work around this by making a separate /boot partition near the beginning of the **unknown** ( note that this is *not* the same as the BIOS Boot Partition) . __eou__
yes the daily are not live cds __eou__

hmm , that 's unfortunate . i was under the impression that this would be fairly straightforward . __eou__
is your swap bigger then your ram ? __eou__
I am not using grub , wubi set it up with windows boot loader . __eou__ I think o_O __eou__
yes __eou__
Sorry I know you're helping a lot of people at once here , but should I be hitting space / f6 before or after this to get the NOMODESET option ? **unknown** ? I've tried both to little avail . Hitting f6 actually ON that menu takes me to a blank screen which dissapears after a short while . __eou__

I don't know , but that 's now what I wrote ... __eou__
:) __eou__ That actully made my day . Thank you very much !! __eou__
Never mind . You said " nothing happens " if you run " sudo apt-get install -f "? Nothing of nothing ? __eou__
ATI IXP not muted __eou__

thanks let me check . __eou__ is that a console client or does it have a GUI ? __eou__
how am i being a troll ? __eou__

Oh nice , it does have a -s for symbolic links __eou__ Thanks a gon __eou__ ... er **unknown** __eou__ lol , " can make relative symbolic links only in current directory " __eou__
odd , find didn't do that here __eou__
oh I have Ubuntu tweak , so I can use that to clean the PPAs __eou__ ok I re-enabled the **unknown** __eou__ ok now the ia32-libs is installing along with a thousand other packes __eou__
Please give example paths , your sentence is still ambiguous . __eou__ cp -r original_dir copy __eou__
darn ... that would have been easier to diagnose . Again ... I have company and have to leave . Hopefully someone else will be able to help you . http://paste.ubuntu.com/1136787/ is your aplay __eou__
OK , next time mod your . dmrc . Just have a look . __eou__
That doesn't seem to do anything __eou__
thanks ill take a look __eou__
There 's no folder " fstab " but there 's an empty folder called " fsta **unknown** " __eou__ Thanks __eou__
I have , like I said precise pangolin installed on my external harddrive which is attached to my HP **unknown** tm2 that has Hybrid Graphic Cards , now I don't know what " mux " means , and I'm having a problem making the driver work , I mean the sys __eou__
ubuntu didn't start and didn't run up , it just keep playing with this dots for ever __eou__
i don't want to use a live drive I want a full installation on my flash __eou__
yes , it needs alerting to the compiler to add the module etc __eou__ what drives ? __eou__
no , i get this message when i try to boot __eou__
modprobe what ? __eou__
ok , thanks , never had such bug / that 's exactly why i don't like to update since all my HW works perfectly on my current Ubuntu . __eou__
maverick is no longer supported __eou__
ok reboot to the ' bad ' version , what does the same command output ? __eou__
it says Authentication token manipulation error __eou__
the default will go to /etc/X11 afaik __eou__
Should I reboot the PC after the install ? __eou__
ya - inside a file on the windows parition __eou__
SolarisBoy hey , thanks for the df recommendation . df -hT , parted -l , and lshw -l are what I needed . __eou__
As much as I can , or at the very least my **unknown** install so I can get my passwords and files back . : x __eou__
hahaha Mark Shuttleworth is not a fluffy animal :) __eou__
What about 3.4 precise or 3.5 quantal ? i'm new to ubuntu and linux in general and atm i have some issues with fan not working properly and also a significant increase in heating compared to win 7 __eou__
**unknown** : i see now it is in the media folder thx for the df -h calzifer ! __eou__
yeah , the factoid should be updated __eou__
javascript , html , php , jquery/ui __eou__
THANKS That 's it ! __eou__
how did you fix it ? __eou__
Yeah but I also have 64-bit versions of libgtk 1.2 __eou__
I saw that ... I felt that was a bit extreme __eou__
I did specify ubuntu ... lol Again ... I am not trying to be ... whatever ... just clear __eou__
ok i understand __eou__
pm ? __eou__ can i pm ? __eou__
glad its working for you , move up to i7 and you will be amazed __eou__
The problem is there really is no interface as user friendly as explorer . exe __eou__ MATE comes close , but really , they all have prety big downsides __eou__
well the build has start again __eou__ the issue still occur :-/ __eou__
did you install ubuntu from windows ? __eou__
ive seen that issue with hackintosh systems __eou__ cannot load hdd hardware info __eou__ if you can , try another sata port , or another hd __eou__
in a terminal ... please give me the output of lspci -nn | grep VGA __eou__ /etc/X11/xorg . conf __eou__
I will check it out thx __eou__
Yeah I know . Nothing I can do about it though . I don't use it . I'm weird and like being grammatically correct . __eou__
It has 2 GB Ram , so I guess 32 is going to be the way I will go __eou__
probably , you could boot a live ubuntu cd and look at it with gparted or use the windows partitioner to identify it . __eou__ are you sure that D is a second HD , not just a partition ? __eou__
Thanks for the offer . I have installed Ubuntu several times no , so I think I am good . __eou__
Ah I see , then I don't kmow . __eou__ have you checked the md5sum of the disc __eou__ you using the something other manual install option ? __eou__ Can you be a little more clear on what you are doing ay least for me and be sure to use nicks . ;) __eou__ A true dual boot is partitioned installs , the ubuntu install from windows is only a file in windows . __eou__ Are doing a manual install from the something else option on the live cd install ? __eou__ And how are you doing that ? __eou__ If you were paying attention at the gui before that one there was a something else option , this is why I asked you that first . __eou__ Not sure to be honest we are not really communicating , so I can't help in good concious . ;) __eou__ I think the channel in general is your best help with the info you have given , someone can do it no biggie . ;) __eou__
wait yes it does , hold on .. __eou__
Not really . __eou__
i'd just like some help if possible :P __eou__
How would I go about checking the repository ? __eou__
for a new ubuntu install you can choose to keep your data aswell .. __eou__
i dont know much about chmod , but there 's that plus maybe use sudo on your copy command . __eou__ how come you dont read those links ? __eou__
I know that . __eou__
you know what you did ... what did you do before rebooting ? is this an attempted first install ? is this a **unknown** ? __eou__ i suspect you did not correctly assign " / " __eou__ remove the HD , CD drive , etc and attempt to boot from usb again __eou__ wait wait __eou__ is your computer 32 bit and you downlaoded 64 bit ? __eou__ has linux been installed on this machine previously ? __eou__ so you cannot get to the main window where you select boot in compatibility mode , etc ? __eou__ it 's possible your usb install is corrupted . did you do an md5sum to make sure the download was correct , and another md5sum to make sure the liveusb was correct ? __eou__ have you been inside the bios to make sure secure-boot is turned off ? __eou__
i know mate __eou__
and how can I get it to reload the nameserver list ? __eou__
i already install it . is running but i can access it in windows . something like server error __eou__
nope ... __eou__ that 's why i use the other one __eou__
yeah , might very well be . I just managed to reproduce it 3 more times , and it started working again . __eou__
oh you can also use usermod to set password __eou__
can I pvt msg you ? __eou__
k __eou__
cu command/gps help . I'm struggling to understand something __eou__
i dont have windows installed __eou__
and you need that server that urgent so you don't have the time to read about the things it does ? I really recommend you do . __eou__
ok ... but my usb device isn't a usb pen , but it 's a mobile __eou__
no , but consider what happens when you start using it , for instance , playing a video . Certainly worth trying though . I'd be interested to hear how it goes . __eou__ clean install . don't be lazy . __eou__
No . __eou__
- I have been using Wubi for a while , and now I want to migrate it to a partition so I can customize by bootloader , hibernate , and have more than 30 GB memory __eou__
I told you - create a Makefile __eou__ in the same directory as the source code __eou__
yes installation going on __eou__
y_y __eou__
you still around ? __eou__ - do you know which version of the terminal script I'm supposed to run ? __eou__
**unknown** : how many seconds boot time ? __eou__
i understand what you said the first time . It might actually be a filesystem issue . __eou__ like cross-linked files __eou__
thanks for the background info __eou__
On a mac you can't access bios __eou__
the terminal __eou__ http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20081224191928555/FileManagers.html __eou__
what ip ? __eou__
what 's the error ? __eou__
lubuntu and xubuntu __eou__
thanks . __eou__
well what ive done is exactly that , so i've got all the old stuff I need , but I need to install a C Compiler , and I cant find out how to install one , I tried : sudo apt-get install build-essential but it says it can't find it , so thats where i'm at , i was thinking of changing it back to the normal sources . list but no luck , any ideas ? __eou__
Well , it 's supposed to work fine , but if you're experiencing issues then that 's your problem :P __eou__
how to take it off __eou__
Oh , huh , so you have screen reader ? __eou__ Just get rid of that and you'll be more or less good to go __eou__
np , I will give 64bit another try __eou__
i know but i need 1.7 __eou__
:) ipv6 ports ! ;p __eou__
ok , thanks . I'll look into that . __eou__
you really should try the recommended driver , IMO __eou__
thank you __eou__
also I would strongly recommend not using FTP . use sftp instead __eou__
it works just with the -- **unknown** option set . __eou__ since 2006 __eou__
create a huge file ( dd urandom ) and copy that over __eou__ should be done in a flash __eou__
YES __eou__
hm , isnt that ' cheating ' ? __eou__
this is after i d/l the iso and burn and install __eou__
i posted there too , I'm wondering if its ubuntu specific ( or at least bonding ) __eou__
usb-cable __eou__ i cant find thei tunes in our sofware center __eou__
no it 's software helper __eou__
I did __eou__
thanks i've found it __eou__
so .. there 's no lts for 11.04 __eou__
try kompozer __eou__
ah that might be it __eou__
inotifywait -mr -- **unknown** ' **unknown** %H : %M ' -- format ' **unknown** %T ' . **unknown** Given that I have tried with all ( " ' ` ) __eou__ And also : inotifywait -mr -- **unknown** " %H%M%S " -- format " **unknown** " . **unknown** __eou__
i was mostly asking because i need to know what to save my script for launching myy minecraft server in as __eou__
" needs " to be on the webserver so that everybody can access from everywhere - not just from the local LAN . Most of those files are internal-use only , not for the public __eou__
yes . wondering if i could trigger vpn to automatically sign in . But when it does , all otehr **unknown** is sent via the webserver too , which is of course not optimal __eou__
if I format them I will lost my data , I dont want that . __eou__
You say that this is the case ... but you have not done it . If it is the case , then the problem is with your windows VM __eou__
You can do many things with Amazon S3 too __eou__
thanks __eou__
use software centre or synaptic or apt-get __eou__ you are on your own if you are not using the repos __eou__
No one accused you of giving false information . There is a big difference between false and useless information , you know ? __eou__
wonderful , thats what I was saying , thank you a lot ! __eou__
I read a lot of stuff . I want it on the right __eou__ I found dockbarx which is a panel replacement __eou__
o __eou__
I don't though . I am using my shell and it doesn't have it installed . It is an older version of ubuntu __eou__
oh , I imagine you can still use images , look at the Ambiance theme , there are a bunch of images in the gtk- 3.0 **unknown** folder __eou__ you'd need to use css still though , you can just use the **unknown** ) property __eou__
BSD doesn't precede options with the " - " __eou__ No , the " ps " command is available on multiple operating systems and on , say , BSD , it expects different options . The program is built to accept three options forms : BSD , Unix , and GNU __eou__
What would channel 6 have to do with it ? OR , a combination of 802.11 g and channel 6 ? Sounds a bit far fetched , not sure what could do that - I'd like to know .... __eou__
it 's not about ubuntu configurations __eou__
yes . do NOT install that . __eou__ it is not in any way tied to the Ubuntu package system . it is installed by you alone . you alone will need to maintain it . if you ever get a kernel upgrade , you will boot into the terminal , reconfigure the latest driver to match the latest kernel , enable the module , reboot , and check X configuration . you know how to do all that , right ? __eou__ then as i said , you do not NEED 3D acceleration . __eou__ can you see a GUI ? __eou__ then *what do you need another driver for* ? __eou__ http://linux.die.net/man/4/radeon __eou__
You cant . Arrange your displays so they dont break that limit . __eou__ And together , they are bigger than your virtual desktop size . __eou__ Because windows uses another driver . __eou__
yes __eou__
That would depend on the device itself , and the OS and tools on it . __eou__
which one do you recommend most ? __eou__
usr13 , thx __eou__
A'ight. __eou__ No errors there . I can vnc into it , by the way , but the desktop it still dead to mouseclicks in vnc . ( Multiple reboots have been tried , of course ) __eou__
yah __eou__
So I'm safe to ignore it until it 's patched ? __eou__
good to know , thanks __eou__
I am not sur __eou__
i have Transmission but Magnets don't work __eou__
or the pendrivelinux site tools __eou__
yeah __eou__
thanks ... can you do the same for " lsusb " ? __eou__ I'm trying to get a feel for what IS there __eou__
oh , you mean in the GUI terminal ... I don't know that you can . that would be an application function __eou__ In Terminal , if you look at the Tabs menu , you'll see it says to use Ctrl+PgDn and Ctrl+PgUp to move between the tabs __eou__
get the interface with " ifconfig " and then write " ifconfig < name of interface > down " __eou__
OK , and you also followed that with " sudo update-grub " ? __eou__
oh , sorry , I thought I saw a -r in there . I haven't had my caffiene yet this morning . __eou__
I got out of that mess years ago , but if you're doing that why aren't you using TSM for MOM ? __eou__
its /dev . sda1 : windows 7 ( loader) : windows : chain __eou__
i'm tempted to use ! wfm ;) plus manual DEBs won't be updated properly , and updates to the system can break them ... __eou__
ah , will have a look , thanks __eou__
i am on ubuntu , but i want to install the **unknown** . iso on an usb-stick __eou__
You're welcome . __eou__
Sorry , my comment was indeed meant for quick- __eou__
your welcome __eou__ you do realize though that 12.10 is still alpha though right __eou__ and it may not be 100% stable __eou__
i know . __eou__
On a side note , your pastebin shows it is AC'97 compatible , I found drivers at http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/hsf/full/downloads-ubuntu-x86.php I assume you require a Conexant Audio driver based on the laptop model . __eou__
Okay , sooo if I want to play with Compiz /at all/ then Unity isn't the answer either ? So if not Unity and not Gnome Shell but I want a GTK desktop , what other options do I have ? __eou__
Well if it has a gig of ram , it should be more than enough . __eou__
in other words , its not possible to make ur unity crash when using ccsm ? __eou__ u do . __eou__ just one link for you : **unknown** next time before you act like the allmighty individual u better **unknown** ... __eou__
fine , I'll try __eou__ I used " wubi " __eou__
what size would you reccomend ? __eou__
I tell you so it 's in your hands . __eou__

You're only running one instance of ubuntu at a time . Right ? __eou__ Therefore , you only need one swap partition . __eou__
looks like your proxy settings are interfering with apt __eou__ I don't mush about proxy settings though , don't think I'll be able to help there __eou__
I should have backups of my more important files . Thanks for the help . __eou__
here are lsusb and dmesg __eou__
So I can configure each instances /etc/fstab to just use the swap partition they were assigned ? __eou__
I've been to that page , but it doesn't address AMD at all __eou__
well , good luck with that :) I've never really been satisfied with the everything-in-one laptop . Typically they don't perform well enough or they are noisy , hot and plastic'y __eou__ well , never buy a pc before you're set up somewhere ;) __eou__
I think I probably will game quite a bit if I have a dedicated card . That 's why I'm putting so much weight on this decision __eou__
cant tell if sarcasm __eou__ Thinkpad W520 __eou__ pretty new and well supported ( or so ive heard ) __eou__ its got the optimus graphics __eou__ between an intel 3000 __eou__
It 's an Acer D257 netbook __eou__ with Ubuntu 12.04 with all updates __eou__
MATE ? __eou__
yea maybe , but i dont quite have alot of experience so freebsd may not be so great __eou__
you can install gnome fallback which is very fast or just try out xubuntu , its a good community __eou__
is there a way to move unity 's dock to the bottom of the screen ? __eou__
jblack , nope it wont , I just get the first image __eou__
im trying to boot ubuntu from a live pen on a ChromeOS acer aspire one __eou__
did you try unplugging ? __eou__
Don't have ubuntu running on a laptop . It 's a desktop system . Asus P5NSLI with an Intel X6800 . 8GB ram . 120GB SSD for the OS and Home . Highpoint Rocketraid 3560 with 4 2TB drives running in R6 . Monitor is an Asus monitor __eou__ Yep and they are active and working . __eou__ The restricted drivers yes . __eou__ Just annoying that it says laptop for the display . Thanks for the help . __eou__
Ok that gave me the terminal . just ran unity -- reset ( compiz ( decor ) - Warn : failed to bind pixmap to texture ) __eou__ Ok it looks like the unity desktop is fubar for some reason on a new install . would apt get work ? ( got a screen full of errors and warns with the unity -- reset command ) __eou__
lol ok __eou__
Sorry , maybe i dident understand well , can you repeat it for me ? sorry again __eou__
ok , i just figured i'd ask here incase I was just retarded lol __eou__
Try installing avant-window-navigator . __eou__ No . __eou__ If you need iMovie specifically , you need a mac . We can't change that . __eou__ There are video editors available for Ubuntu . And I doubt that your teacher specifically requires iMovie . __eou__ Among other things , that would cause problems for the majority of students , who are probably running Windows ( which can't run iMovie either) . __eou__ Open the file in LibreOffice and save as docx . __eou__
Rebooting now . Will be back . __eou__ Thanks again . __eou__ It does seem little better .... But it is still jerky/laggy __eou__
wow now thats quite clever isnt it __eou__
I would like to have it stop doing that . __eou__
I hope not , i've got work to do ! gimme another minute ... trying to find the right chunk of dmesg __eou__ also , wouldn't I be unable to boot under those circumstances , I'm running fine on the setup right now , but ittle go nuts in a few minutes ... __eou__
any clue where I can locate it ? __eou__
it seems to have worked but it is still doing stuff and I am getting a lot of warnings and errors in the terminal __eou__ think I should just control C it ? __eou__
I set top edge left edge and right edge to 0 in the grid setting __eou__

I'll give that a shot -- downloading the LiveCD now . Thank you for your input , sir ! __eou__
And the process will most likely involve wrecking your desktop a few times . __eou__
it simply wait indefinitely trying to open __eou__
what application ? __eou__
only sorta ... :P __eou__
it tells me : 1 item , 10 items under the size column __eou__
yes I did and it doesn't unfortunately :) __eou__ yes I tried all latest ... i found the sourceforge link and downloaded the thing but dunno what to do with it __eou__
patrick ? **unknown** __eou__
wait ... all this for a ... file manager ? __eou__
Looks like you'll have to use either : 1 . The alternate 32-bit CD . 2 . A different ubuntu flavor or distrobution __eou__
Ok . And if that doesn't work , set it solely to ipv4 . __eou__
As a minor and as a female , it 's hard to be considered a pedo . haha __eou__
I'm honestly puzzled , but also a little tired . <_> __eou__

yea not like the old PPC mac days . __eou__
In any case , your name is pretty offensive . You should use another in channels like this . There 's a high standard of courtesy __eou__
I already have them downloaded , just need to change the flv vids to something else . __eou__

you're right : kernel -29 here too __eou__
what 's the bug ? __eou__ Is the graphics in your PC very recent ? __eou__
Is it still failing with errors ? __eou__
fsck etc . or just reinstall if there 's no data outside /home you care about . see what happens . __eou__
great , thanks ! __eou__ 0700 ? __eou__ chown : cannot access `.gvfs': Permission denied , and that is with root :/ __eou__

I think even the desktop one is capable of it __eou__
thx __eou__ unfortunately the program isn't installed from the repositories __eou__
even within openvz ? __eou__
is there a way to just restart it so i don't have to close the programs i have open ? like when you restart unity by killing it __eou__
I'm working entirely in the console . First off , it was a GUI-ish program ; these were dialogs . Second , I'd have no way to copy/paste them . __eou__
Problem is , I haven't ' **unknown** I swear that that didn't show up last time , which may be the case , or I could have been mistaken as last time I futsed with it , the time was as late as it is now for me ( **unknown** ) I'll be sure to come back if it doesn't work , but I think we got it __eou__
Ah . Compile time hahahaha __eou__ Oh that 's right . Closed source . __eou__ Well , probably still have to build a module __eou__ Partition issues ? __eou__ Do you still have the source code if the original install ? The bad one ? __eou__
As I read the error reports are not fatal and update-grub succeeds ; it 's just that its ' probing of the devices is getting confused __eou__
in fact they released 3 . __eou__ xp is heavily used thats why microsoft extended support till 2014 __eou__ I think it 's 2014 __eou__ anyway my point is this , ubuntu doesn't change that much that past distros shouldn't have access to latest repo , but i'll look into rolling release , thanks __eou__ and I appreciate your guys hard work __eou__
I'll try , but i'm not sure how to do that on android or ubuntu __eou__
well , " R " is the only letter there __eou__ wrong __eou__ you're right __eou__
yeah i tried using the rt2800pci module , it does not work __eou__ i am trying ndiswrapper as last resort __eou__ i saw some people posting the same problem but no real solution __eou__
:/ __eou__
don't pull the . sys yet , it hasn't finished uploading __eou__ OK , it 's done , you can grab them now __eou__ rt2860 . inf : Little-endian UTF-16 Unicode text , with CRLF line terminators __eou__
No they don't __eou__ Not anymore __eou__
I think you need a certain package ; do a regex for esx __eou__
i know , but random 10c+ spikes arent normal for desktop use ... dont have this issue in windows __eou__
OpenVZ is a container-based Virtual Machine so what you run is what 's on the host __eou__
I want to boot up without a gui __eou__
yes __eou__ does that work with the nvidia driver ? __eou__
link it :P __eou__
Oh , fb __eou__ I thought you said " fd0 " which is a floppy drive __eou__ Then yeah , I think that 's the case __eou__
PM me ( wine is not a topic of this channel) , though __eou__
These new ( as of a couple of years ago , anyway ) used a new block size that meant that ( at the time ) perfomance DID depend on partitioning details . __eou__ Found an answer : " The Linux kernel has had specific support for the alternate sector sizes and offsets used by WD Advanced Format disk drives since version 2.6 . 31 ". So I guess it 's no longer necessary to partition in a particular way . __eou__
this is my basic concern . If such conditions limit its ' lifespan then i must find other way to cool it down __eou__
there is an button , view , when you click on it you see all running apps __eou__
sounds like your monitor is not scaling smaller images . just showing them at their original res . __eou__
will try that __eou__ that is not fixing it . Will you advice doing apt-get upgrade -f ? __eou__
i just need to alter the startup script for doom3 to fix the sound , but i can't find the script . i'm a nobe :) __eou__ or noob , whatever __eou__
latest __eou__
case is imporntant .. and it may be /usr/local/games __eou__
just root and me . __eou__ Whats this for ?? __eou__
thank you my friend . Should I send the kidney or the baby first ? __eou__
the " windows " button , and then type additional drivers __eou__
my battery is broken and it will constantly report it 's 0% charged __eou__
i created a . desktop file put it in the appropriate folder , the icon shows up but clicking on it doesn't launch the program . if i launch from the command line it works __eou__ there is no run as option when i right click fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 LTS __eou__
Oh , OK . It 's odd because I have installed any updates . __eou__
thanks __eou__
GRAPHICALLY __eou__
I assumed you'd already linked your home directory by enabling userdir 's in the apache configuration ? __eou__
If I need to run a browser from localhost ( the webserver) . I would need one , no ? __eou__
" sites-available : this directory has configuration files for Apache2 Virtual Hosts . Virtual Hosts allow Apache2 to be configured for multiple sites that have separate configurations . " __eou__
other then trying a older kernel . i got no other ideas . i dont use wubi , and i dont reccomend using wubi __eou__
That 's fine . As long as I can run a startx and get to a gui life is fine __eou__
i mean , 3.2 . 0-29 __eou__
Take up running it works ! :) __eou__
link to that guide ? im reeding the official pdf one . __eou__
ok , ty __eou__
, i have set the limit previously and i forgot how to set it back __eou__
some common linksys or netgrar gizmo . sold for game consoles mainly __eou__
If anyone can give me some advice , I'd appreciate it ; I just had what I think is a HDD failure in my Ubuntu box that I was using as a file server . I pulled the drive , and tried to read it on a windows box with a USB HDD reader to no avail . Just loaded 12.04 onto a new HDD in the Ubuntu box , and tried reading the old HDD ( once again with USB HDD reader ) and I'm only able to see 255MB worth of __eou__ space on the old drive . Gnome and some other Ubuntu stuff is on there , but I can't see any of the files that I was saving to that drive . Any good way ( program ? ) to use to try to access the data ? If it helps , the failure message I was getting with the old Ubuntu/Drive setup was a Kernel Panic - Not Syncing errror . __eou__
total beginer = python __eou__ 1000 's of them ;) __eou__
it will wipe your hdd __eou__ there is also the more comfortable option of ddrescue /dev/urandom /dev/sda . i very much like its output and other capabilities so i use it for all main dd stuff __eou__ then there is very much likely something wrong with the hdd . __eou__
no software packages have spaces in them - although for " nice " display in GUIs they might be added . What 's the package you want to install ? __eou__
oh , okay __eou__
An other *little* qeustion . Which Programming language do you recomend starting with ? __eou__
the motherboard on the server is a IBM **unknown** __eou__
Got it . Thanks ! __eou__
Are there restrictions ? __eou__
Thank **unknown** start doing some research on that right now . __eou__
I didn't really understand what you want to say __eou__
You may want to ask in #kubuntu , more KDE folks there ;) __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
It also provides a simple web GUI for controlling it __eou__ Ubuntu __eou__
See you at christmas then __eou__
Thanks ! __eou__
Ahhh OK . You could set up a static route on your source PC telling it to route all packets for the VM via the VM 's host IP __eou__ something like " ip route add 192.168 . 2.4 /32 via **unknown** . **unknown** dev eth0 " and then ensure IPv4 forwarding is enabled on the VM 's host __eou__
should be able to with the right type of networking . I dont use vmware , so I cant say how to set it __eou__
No , i'm unable to click on install __eou__
You don't I guess ... not unless you want to build the software yourself ! __eou__
TJ- , thank you , it worked , yay !!! __eou__
it 's like globbing in the shell , are you familiar with it ? Basically , it means " any characters here " __eou__
I'll try it , thank you __eou__
if so probably needs a new modeline generating and adding to that output __eou__
we're here to learn :) __eou__
thanks __eou__
i think that means its 32bit __eou__
i think it 's better to wait in #ubuntu-fr , just be patient __eou__
well , it is a different computer : the last line is Kernel modules : i915 __eou__ does that help ? __eou__
ok i did that though , i installed it to the fakeraid volume __eou__ which would be the mbr __eou__ do you know what I mean when I refer to fakeraid ? __eou__
what is " netmask " and " gateway " __eou__
We had it earlier and I couldn't find any definitive information , but several reports of non-PAE apparently booting using that mini iso __eou__ Correct __eou__
thx , but why will the 32bit iso not boot on that laptop ? __eou__
yes unity is what I am using __eou__
Are you suggesting that I will experience problems when I upgrade this antique to Precise ? __eou__
hopefully it will be one-time-only installation of packages , so i wouldnt mind . I was just interested if any had done something entirely different __eou__
I did accidentally a word . Honestly , because I'm a game developer and I tell my users to use the latest official drivers , so it seems that I should develop on them . ( Also , the repo versions don't come with all the delicious headers and extra libraries . ) __eou__
Dunno much about mac . I want to get one as it is good brand with nice configuration __eou__
which file is the 32bit iso file ? i downloaded " ubuntu- 12.04 **unknown** . iso " __eou__
i dont mean to actual use the ubuntu one folders as workspaces , but using it to share it when i need to backup __eou__ i have a few friends who uses this methods on their macs , which seems to work very nice __eou__
the correct survey is located at : goo . **unknown** __eou__
Nah , not distro versions . Package updates __eou__
sorry I am laggin __eou__ its working fine for me , infact I am online through it now ... but its speed is limited i dont know why it doesnt connect to the 3g network __eou__
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors __eou__
well , the nickname would be the same either way , I just prefer the look of :, and you reminded me of that . As for nested playlists , maybe I'll for myself to spend some of my free time improving one of the open source audio programs out there . __eou__ *force* __eou__
i said the error already . :/ . I get it when i sudo . **unknown** . bin __eou__
installing adobe AIR on kunbuntu 12.04 . I got an error about permissions and to contact admin .. But i'm admin > . < __eou__ i even tryed to sudo su , but still not working : S __eou__
thanks __eou__
what you mean ? __eou__
well it doesn't disconnect , it just loses the signal __eou__
THat 's fine , I'm here for an issue you'll probably have after we get your monitor to display correctly , Unity gets buggy with two monitors sometimes . __eou__
wine forum says that wine is having issue with 12.04 __eou__ i had problem with installing gem i install ruby with rvm __eou__
It kinda is an ubuntu issue , he says the ubuntu live cd won't boot . I assume this is because of gnome 3 . __eou__
v12 what ? __eou__
hmm , yeah win7 is rather heavy in a vm __eou__
: I sent a bug report several times , but realized that that bug has already been loged __eou__
nope , not in the Software Center . I searched " encode video " and found Transmageddon , but it has bad reviews . I have experience with Handbrake but for some reason it 's not in the repositories __eou__
In all previous versions of **unknown** I've used , every application had its own icon __eou__
cmiller i normally use the xming wizard to just open a xterminal , and not use putty __eou__ cmiller vnc or freenx may work well for you also __eou__
yes , i believe so __eou__ hdmi __eou__
i think bitdefender addon causing problem __eou__
nevermind . I must have spelled it wrong . THANKS __eou__
Are you saying what I want to do is not possible , or the circumstances I observed ( getting control of the session back when I reconnect ) are not possible ? __eou__
Yeah , same here too . I don't like it that some come in and expect an answer before they have hit their enter key . :-( __eou__ OT : I'm very much an irssi girl . __eou__
That could be some kind of ' kernel panic'. As stated , check the kernel logs in /var/log ... __eou__
what ssh client is doing that ? mine disconnect when i move to the other networks __eou__
aye , not sure how to check those things in linux . Any suggestions ? __eou__
I posted a message to you by acident . ;) __eou__
cool just wanted to make sure you had any resource needed . ;) __eou__
well , because then I have an extra step ( rsync) , and I may be editing dozens of files at a time in different directory trees . __eou__
perhaps , but I don't know how __eou__
and regular updates ? __eou__
select your name , password and press the ' > ' to select DM __eou__
I guess you will have to create something like a ' bluetooth audio reciever'. Otherwise your phone will not see the computer as audio device I guess . __eou__ I would look for something like this ... http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1464189.html __eou__
=) __eou__
that iptables rule needs a few modifications __eou__
i know . i wish upgrades went smooth , but they never seem to ... __eou__
Re-install the the related packages . There are meta packages that will give you everything . Requires some patience during download and installation but it usually fixes it . __eou__
the latest avalable is 11 on 12.04 __eou__
yeah sure __eou__
hmmm no idea you might try googling __eou__
is a user deadmund __eou__ i would trust something like spinrite __eou__ actually i would only trust spinrite __eou__
haha __eou__ yep __eou__
why are you asking for advice with Arch in the Ubuntu channel ? __eou__
If you PM me there won't be so much noise . /etc/modprobe . **unknown** . conf __eou__ hi __eou__ like this -> /whipser deadmund Hello there ! __eou__
*shocked* __eou__
yeah sorry for that :/ but somehow I cant see anywhere information about DHCP pool or anything of that sort . __eou__
You can see something on your display . Successfully tested :P __eou__
don't agree on Mint being prettier though . They tried to pretty up a common street prostitute ( Gnome3 ) with moderate success . __eou__
yes , trying my luck in #vim as well __eou__
i've configured the interfaces file to use 192.168 . 1.3 but still it wants 192.168 . 1.4 __eou__
Thanks . I'm stupid . __eou__
thank you :) __eou__
Yes but not yet __eou__
I'll google for NFS myself and have a go . I wasn't sure whether NFS and Samba were an either/or thing or if I could have both running to access different things . __eou__
Try compiz without installing drivers __eou__
and for the record , a used port isn't the only possible problem __eou__ well first make sure that the problem is an occupied port __eou__ hence netstat and **unknown** __eou__
Thats nonsense . __eou__
in SSH like now ? __eou__
i mean on that computer __eou__
' network address ' can be used to denote mean ' host address .' but if you want to play semantics , then both . 0 and . 255 are network addresses , which makes your originl statement useless __eou__
Look at the power management settings . I don't know exactly where it is in the gui __eou__
no for gnome __eou__ Yes I agree =) __eou__
search for statup programs/ what do you want to run ? what program ? __eou__
Good ;) __eou__
yes , you need them both . __eou__
thanks __eou__
The answer I was looking for is " make a shell script that says " grep -i $1 " __eou__
Tehre are a variety of options you have . You can switch on debugging or check the status . Also , If all fails restart the daemon . __eou__ In a terminal window check man avahi or see http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/avahi-daemon.8.html __eou__
sorry , i hate low level stuff :-p __eou__
me either . It 's a **unknown** . __eou__
Currently I'm running on a live cd , so deleting partitions isn't much of a problem . I'm still confused as to which file system type and mount point to use for the partitions . __eou__
whoa whoa whoa __eou__ wrong __eou__ He can try to set a new modeline in xrandr __eou__
I've got two physical drives . 120gb and a 80gb . I wanted to dual boot ubuntu and arch on the 120 and use my 80gb as storage __eou__
I tried Puppy already , it 's kind of **unknown** ! ) perhaps it 's the GPU , i'll try DSL ! Thank you ! __eou__
TheMadDrizzle I agree with that __eou__
256 mb , 512 mb __eou__ i heard that 64 bit takes away a bit of your ram __eou__
thanks it 's called " System Load Indicator " in Software Center . __eou__
here is the result , the errors are towards the end __eou__
thanks it works yeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiihh __eou__
YOu can also ask questions of it is Ubuntu related , ie seahorse , GPG . __eou__
let me check __eou__ nope , I cant access the drive with mount __eou__ correction , I can mount it __eou__
If I get that one right all you would need to do is to use your old key rings , revoke your old but valid key and create a new one . Your old private key should be preserved . Once you have done that you can copy it over to the other machine . I strongly suggest to make a backup of both key rings for secure and public keys . __eou__
sorry -- rarely use ICQ so don't know about things like pastebin . __eou__
its jumping all over the place but is never under 30 and its about 80 percent __eou__
does this log file tell what patches are applied ? I don't have an active ubuntu installation , but I've been using a kubuntu livecd for testing purposes __eou__
yes but I found it through a file search , it was in the " Public folder even though I'd specifically set it to go in Downloads folder . Oh , well . Sorry for false alarm . __eou__
**unknown** . con **unknown** __eou__
... first off , i know what a path is , secondly , it does not exist on ubuntu . __eou__
ubuntu or windows ? Windows has max 1024x768 __eou__
i imagine you always want to use this for swap space ? __eou__ if we want to do this the right way we'll need the UUID . 1 sec . __eou__ ls -laH /dev/disk/by-uuid/ __eou__
ah , ok __eou__
Ok , I'll try an email forum instead . __eou__
what is the blkid command ? __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
lol __eou__
with vnc viewer there is no screensize option . __eou__

It is difficult for me to understand you . May be the reason is that my native language is not Englisch . I did not state that " /6667 is the port ." __eou__
I develop games . I wish to compile my games in a way that Windows users can play them . I do not have a copy of Windows at present . __eou__
yea i was looking at ffmpeg but unsure how to do it ... __eou__ hmm ok - I'm looking forward to have this all setup and then not having to worry about it lol __eou__
thanks I'll be right back then __eou__ Yeap , that did the trick , THANKS ! __eou__
Should it be set to AHCI ? __eou__
Thanks __eou__
aww , thanks __eou__
I use CTRL+ALT+F5 usually .. but how do I get back to GUI ? __eou__
to install win7 dualboot , many reccomend make a new partition from within win7 first , to install ubuntu on __eou__
Ah . I'd better register then =) __eou__
I have attempted but failed . __eou__
I'm not sure . If I go to the Home folder I can see my drives like I do in Windows . I see my 189 GB partition and 811 gb partition of my 1 TB hard drive . I also see my 2 tb hard drive . I want to install ubuntu on my 811 GB hard drive . __eou__ The installer is not telling me the size of the devices so I am not able to differentiate between them . __eou__
manufacturers install . __eou__
yea that 's what is giving the error __eou__
Yes , I suppose . Just don't delete Windows 7 . __eou__ I don't see why not . __eou__
udev , I believe . __eou__ You could also try psydm which is graphical . __eou__
' ~$ mount'. Look for a single ' / '. __eou__
mh ... I'm not sure there . You could also try setting the setuid bit of the shell script to root , but that 's extremely dangerous . Ask on #linux , they should know more about this topic __eou__
Try running ' sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* ' __eou__ And then ' sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update ' __eou__
Thanks __eou__
i don't know , sorry . Try some of the files in /var/log __eou__
Possibly . I just went with the flow on the updates that was provided . __eou__ Thing is now , it drags incredibly slow also . __eou__
kernel upgrades do not show up in those updates . __eou__ that 's all i'm sayin __eou__
Please watch your language . __eou__
Hehe I knew something was wrong cat as I know it is just a text read in the terminal . __eou__ knows this stuff though . __eou__
thx __eou__
395 updates yesterday . I was 64 bit . Now its showing 32 bit and running slower than ever __eou__
Home , ruler pencil , paper music and video . Wait , just did a second restart and the apps have returned . __eou__ Thats odd __eou__
ssh-keygen -F hostname __eou__
Then just use an NTP server and you'll be fine . __eou__
OK , thanks , I have to reboot , so I'll see if that works ! __eou__
do you know the command ? __eou__
I don't know how Fedora handles update . I don't use it . __eou__
sorry man . every time I've seen this , a terminal update has fixed . could be you're dealing with a different cause than me . ask in this channel and ubuntu forums . __eou__
Adding each PC or the gateway ? __eou__ I actually did tick the checkbox earlier , but nothing changed . ( didn't know I had to add the local networks ) - Now that I disabled eth0 and enabled it again , it seems to favor wlan0 , without adding any networks . __eou__ Well , I restarted the browser , and back to where I was before . I'll try to add the local networks __eou__ Thanks . :) It seems to work for now . __eou__
it is very super strange , but realtek network card started to work , also see it properly now in hardware list http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140876/ Thanks for help . __eou__
hmmm , I've tried live USB and Xubuntu ran perfectly . Is there anything I can do ? or do I have to install another distro __eou__
see _tj_ ' s question . Also , yes , windows might boot fine . I'm questioning that the ubuntu grub config didn't get scrambled somehow __eou__
start from the beginning , what were you doing before you came here __eou__ keep it in the channel please __eou__
wait , what ? __eou__ im already on a new user __eou__
start by not using eyecandy , also add vm . **unknown** in /etc/sysctl . conf __eou__ don't use to many services at startup __eou__ don't use nm-applet , rather set a fix IP-address __eou__
already done changes in that window __eou__ its all on french but still I have qwerty __eou__
yes __eou__ wuxga i believe __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
use " fdisk -l /dev/sda " to list the partitions , then check the valid file-systems using , for example , " e2fsck /dev/sda1 " __eou__

cheers usr13_ , thought i was going crazy for a mo __eou__
Yea NP __eou__
Well , my initial testing was a flop , so ... I dono . I used the meter on my pone and it was the same with and without . __eou__
no __eou__
Also , check if your USB mouse/kb show up on any search engine if they require special treatment . See **unknown** ) for details . __eou__
cable , no batteries __eou__
Already did that __eou__ the problem is that I can't boot to the live USB __eou__

ext4 added crtime ( create time ) some while ago . it 's stored in the upper 128 bits of the inode __eou__

Thanks ^^ __eou__
well , I thought he want to the the themes element ... LOL __eou__

to use a live CD I would need a live CD __eou__ crap - did not think about the clone being an exact size __eou__
Thanks . __eou__
ok that 's what i thought but i wasn't sure . I'd say it may be the router . __eou__
**unknown** , sudo apt-get install gnome-shell __eou__
heh , yeah . the plan would be to mount **unknown** to somewhere in Ubuntu , so she'll have storage __eou__ what 's the footprint of a " normal " " just install it " installation of ubuntu ? __eou__
good luck my friend __eou__
**unknown** : thanks __eou__
there are system prefs that allow you to set what fonts you use . __eou__
no doubt . I love freenode :) __eou__
I don't really understand what you are trying to do __eou__
perhaps you should use FAT then ... __eou__
what do you mean by " ntfs/ext3 " ? __eou__
I'll try what _TJ_ is saying else I'll try the USB drivers . __eou__
yeah . typo . :p :) __eou__
i did but there is no activity over there __eou__
( i asked this earlier but mirc crashed ) :( __eou__ oke , should've thought of that . linlin : w ? __eou__
usually , but as pb|away states , ask in #winehq __eou__
it looks like that should let me " burn " the Windows 8 Pre-Release ISO I have ? __eou__
nothing is garunteed . but i've run it a dozen times or so without data loss __eou__
yeah but where can I find an older version ? __eou__
When I slip dm-crypt into that , it will pull 100MB/s for ~2 seconds , then freeze the machine for ~90 seconds . Then it will pull another 100MB/sec ... **unknown** , rinse , repeat . __eou__ Gives an effective throughput of **unknown** . __eou__ Has anyone seen that before ? I've been scouring Google/Launchpad/KML/etc for the last three days and haven't run across anything useful . __eou__ Yes . Long since . I built the array and went to bed . Installed the next night . :) __eou__
I know that if you encrypt the block devices and then put a file-system on top of them , it'll be faster than a encrypting a file-system on top of block devices . The reason being , the encryption runs in a single thread per block device . __eou__ Can you test it with dmcrypt > RAID > LVM ? __eou__
the /dev/ttyUSB0 is a standard serial device __eou__ it can be opened just the same as /dev/ttyS* devices __eou__ The clue is in the " tty " part of the device name __eou__ And , if I read back correctly and see mention of ELO - you're trying to use it with an ELO touchscreen . I have one right next to me on an external monitor , and I connected it to this PC using my own USB<>serial converter __eou__
I use one for getting to early boot kernel consoles when testing kernel builds on various hardware __eou__ Famous last words :p __eou__
I am bugging my user right now . He might have answers for you . __eou__
when i plug in what ? __eou__
cool - do I need the alternative installer , or will the regular one do ? __eou__
If you ' burned ' it to a CD you have your installation CD . __eou__
Yes a NTFS r/w is considered stable . __eou__
so to mount " sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt " swap XY with letter and partition number __eou__
I know what am talking about and have done it in windows but am looking for a solution in linux . [ snake ] atleast has an idea of what am talking about . __eou__
have already tried the beast but didn't work . __eou__

yeah thats the reason I have the view function printing out line numbers __eou__
I still have broken packages __eou__ " E : Unable to correct problems , you have held broken packages " __eou__

because he wants to use linux obviously __eou__
ok will try your suggestion thanks __eou__
im paranoid :-P __eou__ you know how MI5 gets rid of data ? __eou__
that would be great __eou__
thanks . Apparently it automatically set itself to use a proxy . Weird . __eou__
install the 2nd what - there 's another NTP ? __eou__
i think i mounted it last night myself __eou__
it actually says that **unknown** than 2.6 . 21 should works without the patch they provide __eou__
it 's a WPA2 AP , iwconfig doesn't support WPA2 . __eou__
then upgrade using the web , saves having to upgradethe OS after __eou__
security would be nice , too , but should be the topmost concern in this case __eou__ what do you suggest as replacement ? __eou__
grep -ri thistext . __eou__
that is what I was thinking ... __eou__
man function_name __eou__ there are also some pages for the individual headers , man stdio ; man string ; etc __eou__
how can i do so ? i'm newbie __eou__
hey thanks ! but don't trouble yourself actually , i think i'm trying this http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/ __eou__ ( but i appreciate it , cheers ) __eou__
try : sudo apt-get -- purge remove flashplugin-installer ; sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree __eou__
sudo apt-get install ppa-purge __eou__
i want to view the contents of the iso install cds so i can point my netboot kickstart install to them __eou__ at least i'm hoping to , i just want a way to access the contents of the install cds from http so i can use via kickstart ( dunno if this is correct or not ) __eou__
sorry but I cannot find a real issue in there __eou__
I thought that it would be ok , but looking for the command line stuff I am going to need to do this , I was working in the Directory of Books Ebooks and Audio Books and apparently pumped it into space perhaps Jupiteer as I don't see the debris on Mars __eou__ does foremost recover mp3 files as a lot of my ebooks are audio ones and those are the most important to me __eou__ can I use -t * . * and recover everything that I have deleted in the past few days on this drive that I want to recover the books on , it would be better if I couls do that as I have lost other stuff in this circle jerk __eou__
probably , but apparently i can't get the used ram to increase even if i open like twenty tabs of youtube inside each VMs __eou__ so i tought that was weird __eou__
how bout that ? Mem : 15959 15769 189 __eou__
I dont see any event when I scroll up or down with xev __eou__
sudo apt-get -- purge remove gnash gnash-common __eou__ then : sudo apt-get -- reinstall install adobe-flashplugin __eou__ not sure , could try it , its free __eou__
OK , shouldn't be a problem . Where did you get the information from ? __eou__
ikonia , i'm not telling it happens as soon as you log on your account , just happened randomly without m eeven doing anything . Maybe just remote desktop , that 's all __eou__
YOu can see what devices are detected . That is , even if there is no driver it tells you it what hardware is available . Among other things , of course . __eou__
this program seems great but it seems they discontinued the project .. the donload is not available anymore __eou__
pci __eou__
True hardware raid ( 24 port card ) __eou__ I got my card for a good deal . 350 and I got 4 of the 6 cables with it ;) __eou__ L4D runs smoother and faster on Linux . Valve proved it via steam . __eou__
i'd never personally use rh ... but it 's an enterprise grade OS __eou__
it 's pretty much red hat . __eou__
see bad luck :) __eou__
soft raid is very forgiving , of course you will have reduced performance , but even green drives will work ( albeit slowly , and you should disable that parking stuff lol ) __eou__
I have a mac book pro at work , and I use only linux at home __eou__ cool , then I might have to get it __eou__
it has installation features , like .. to be able to not install any DE and so on ? __eou__
Alright I will look at ifenslave as well . Thank you __eou__
for non support talk please join #ubuntu-offtopic , repeat the question there :) __eou__
a program that allows you to stress test your CPU giving you a value in Gflops __eou__
That 's a safe assumption , yes . __eou__
you could just try to compile libreoffice __eou__
lol ok __eou__ I missed the first half of the discussion are you having an issue ? __eou__
It 's just that I can't think of any reason why one would want that . Ubuntu just seems like a superior choice as server compared to RH/CentOS in all but some very , very specific cases . __eou__
not at all :) __eou__
Could you let us know your WiFi card . Open a terminal with Alt+Ctrl+t and type in lspci __eou__
Hrmm have you tried loading a different driver for the wireless ? It shouldn't be dropping the connection if the signal strength is steady . Let me look something up __eou__
thank you __eou__
All this to proxy IRC on freenode ? Just joking . __eou__
http://pastebin.com/tTEhwriR __eou__
the list for automatically installed and no longer required is a different list __eou__ How would I use synaptic ? __eou__
when you open your home folder , you should see something under devices like " 64GB Filesystem " or however big your windows partiton is __eou__
for what ? __eou__
using software centre and apt-get will install a large amount of what you need __eou__ in a new install , you'll have a few __eou__ same as a new install of Windows .... __eou__
nice ! what a great ubuntu challenge ! **unknown** , I don't have the answer ... * __eou__ does Canon provide a printer driver for this device ? __eou__
i can't boot the system __eou__
maybe can also try locate __eou__ try locate ( folder_name ) __eou__ any success ? I think the command you wanted to run could be somth like this # find / -name **ebooks* __eou__
I do NOT want to do anything with this drive until I have run foremost , and sure could use some help on the command line __eou__
I am trying to use foremost to recover all my books , ebooks , and audio books that dissappeared this morning and I cant make heads or tails out of the command line for foremost __eou__ It ISN " T There __eou__ Nothing is anywhere on the drive so I must be deleted ..... __eou__
that is a shallow exscuse I must say . ;) __eou__
i can't get to it , because i can't boot the server __eou__
11.10 , 3.0 . 0-23 __eou__
I had the same problem with 10.04 and found out that Firefox was causing the lockups I downloaded the latest version after I deleted the old one and the problem went away __eou__
Do you not have even password authenticated access to the box then ? __eou__ I guess I was assuming that you did . If not , you'll need the monitor and keyboard . __eou__
I know some guys in our office print with a hacked up openoffice writer page . They just kept messing with the margins till it printed right . __eou__
try in ##linux too . __eou__
where is the panel ? __eou__
how do i do that ? __eou__
hmm , and what exactly happened when you overwrote it with another . ogg __eou__
permanently ? __eou__
where ? __eou__
Thank you __eou__
yes . I would copy one config over at a time and make sure if it breaks then you know what broke it and can copy the orig back . __eou__
Lynx __eou__ took me 2 secs to google it . __eou__
Great . Just so you know , always search for things in the Software Center instead of downloading from websites . __eou__
it 's gone __eou__
nuh uh __eou__
what was your problem again ? __eou__
be safe . have fun . __eou__
The square issue disappeared for me when I installed Ubuntu 10 on it ( previously 9.04 ) and has not returned as of 12.04 __eou__
i i will see __eou__
the stdout stderr from " apt-get " __eou__
ah , sorry I don't even recognize the language .. have you tried some programming channels ? __eou__
yes __eou__
no offence but i'm asking for advanced help __eou__
perfect . i see it . thank you __eou__
Yeah it seems to be a recen problem so I'm guessing it happened after 11.04 __eou__ Yeah someone earlier said there was a problem with broadcom . I saw it on google in passing but didn't read up on it sorry __eou__
Ah that I don't know . I would have to google it . __eou__ http://nfs.sourceforge.net/ says it is supported in kernels 2.6 and later __eou__
that 's all i need in fstab ? __eou__
that wouldn't get back to the versions of the packages on the CD ( which I can't see why he would need anyway ) __eou__
*wired* __eou__ no worries . __eou__
No problem . If you say ' see ' you probably use a file manager that shows you the content of the archive . What we need to do is to extract the archive and copy the **unknown** ) to the location that it requires . I assume therefore you know where the downloaded archive is . Can you tell me from where you downloaded conky so I can do the same ? __eou__
Funny how I ran lspci a couple min ago __eou__
i saw type when i ran mount at command . it says it 's ext4 . __eou__
but how to use ssh command to connect ? __eou__ aha thanks only : 7022 is enough __eou__
You mentionned formatting the usb into mac file type . You meant formatting it into GUID ? __eou__
So dd the . iso over with UDRW or **unknown** ? __eou__ I've only been converting because that 's what the instructions on the site said to do . __eou__
Hold down the Option key to show available startup disks . The usb doesn't show up though . __eou__
Ok copying from this system to the ubuntu system it is hitting 95MB . So it seems to be when reading from the ubuntu system to the win7 systems . __eou__ That one didn't but I think I found the oops . It was a nested directory so I think I needed the full path . But yeah I just hit **unknown** so it isn't a network issue . __eou__
yeah , a huge amount not for the begginers in linux __eou__
always wanted to make an eggie ... __eou__
I have webupd8 ppa 's for ( Oracle ) Java , VLC 's ( no longer true , but used to use) , as well as several others ... __eou__
Well easy test . copy from 1 gaming system to the other ( both have SSD in Raid 0 so can hit 1GB read speeds ) and I got **unknown** speeds __eou__ So that would point at something other than the network right ? __eou__
Ah I don't even let my family ony my systems except in a VERY restricted account __eou__
found it , but seems that xfce should have a settings manager to do this somewhere ... __eou__ btw , the goal was to get a non interactive bootup screen ( no progress indicator that halts 10 times ) like in lxde __eou__ installing a little netbook with xubuntu , so ... underpowered and crappy ... and I hate being scared it isn't booting ... __eou__
space ? the defaul image has been **unknown** . png perhaps the new gdm is looking elsewhere then __eou__
I'm not sure ... but at least it gives the prospect of digging around in the logs and changing configuration to test it more __eou__
Yes which is dealing with Spoonless 's issue . FTT ;) __eou__
THX so much :) __eou__
was asking , and seems less familiar with them . __eou__ If you are just using Linux to create your own work , you don't have to worry about the Linux licenses . Create and sell as much as you want . The restrictions are on redistributing Linux , in the same way as you can't sell copies of Windows yourself . __eou__
if you're *using* a program , these issues don't apply . they only apply if you're planning to develop on them and re-sell them __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ download that game , unzipped , clicked the executable , nothing happens __eou__
yes __eou__
I know those licenses very well __eou__
I've approx 2880 rows and I need each row to have time field in the intervals of 10 mins like 9 , 9.10 , 9.20 .. 9.50 , 10.00 for 24 hours __eou__
! cloud | jgcampbell300 __eou__ i think the beginners guide at the end of the site will help you __eou__
How about " sudo chmod -R 644 **unknown** " __eou__
thanks __eou__
" see the various -dump* options to mplayer for example " __eou__
So you probably too the wrong version , or you only tried to install the package , whitout adding the xorg-edgers ppa . Or it could be a bug in the xorg-edgers ppa . __eou__ https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa __eou__
they usually last anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 seconds or so . I should also add that I've gone so far as to wipe the sever and install **unknown** same issues out of the box now . __eou__
don't know the best way to do that then __eou__
not work :( __eou__
okay , thanks __eou__
thank you , I'll try it but I think it will be locked too , these people are crazy __eou__
: i want to su user __eou__
sorry I get mixed up I thought that you could not boot windows __eou__ ! pastebin | [ **unknown** ] __eou__

I did a screeenshot on that pastebin thing __eou__
hmm I live south korea and In my **unknown** .. **unknown** key ) right_alt key is change langues key __eou__
just playing with 12.10 defaults . I tend to try to stay with defaults to make it easier to do support help . __eou__
thanks . I will do . Yes I saw that they were converting it over . At the moment I get steam and the game lobby loading . __eou__
okay , thanks . I've ended up with an odd situation allowing me to run a more graphically intensive DE & I like Gnome shell __eou__
the windows key is technically the ' super ' key __eou__
you need to look at the debian/control file this is how all package managers read dependecys and what not __eou__
: **unknown** ... thx ! __eou__
true . :) __eou__
Anything that is in /usr/local was not placed there by the package manager . What do you have that is looking for a library in /usr/local ? __eou__ apt-file search apt-file __eou__ apt-file search python __eou__
**unknown** : I wouldn't run irssi as root if I were you . __eou__
try to avoid the @name thing , if you use " name :" it appears as a different color on my screen __eou__
Don't know . Anything come go from good to bad __eou__
I think that is supposed to mean " bring up at boot time for all users " so if it isn't coming up I'm not sure why __eou__
you might have better luck in #networking __eou__
I checked the " Install patented codecs " checkbox in the installer . __eou__
there is an option in ccsm under the unity plugin on the experimental tab if you can't access the Display settings __eou__
yah __eou__
yup . it 's at a sensible volume and not muted __eou__
Cntrl-C may stop the command but it doesn't fix my HDD problem . __eou__
I agree ; I just cringe when folks try to use it on a long term basis , upgrades , etc .. But I know what you mean . __eou__
AND you intend to use grub as your bootloader . If , on the other hand , you really want or need to use the Windows bootloader , EasyBCD is your friend . __eou__
I'll give that a try , thanks ! __eou__
after adding the ppa , did you update and install newer versions ? then you need ppa-purge . if the PPA never worked , you can edit your sources and remove it __eou__
if it was inside vbox - i have no suggestions ... __eou__
sure no problem __eou__
how can i know if its a hardware issue ? __eou__ how can i know if its a personal hardware issue ? __eou__
Yes this is Ubuntu but I don't believe there would be an answer here ... not sure ... love to hear what you find out though because I also have a Toshiba and have never found a way __eou__
try this : sudo modprobe r8192e_pci __eou__
please use a ! pastebin to show us the output of ip add and ip route __eou__
12.04 __eou__
so it does work vertically ? __eou__
that would also increase the installer image size considerably . i don't think you can keep packages in the same format for installing as a disk image and regular installing . __eou__
you'd choose one , anyone wanting a different file system would use the other disc that installs individual packages __eou__ but for the raw image copy it would be a default file system __eou__
i get the follwing error __eou__
90% of the time im on my cell phone and CANT check web sites .. __eou__
yes , part of the mechanism is Compiz , not sure about what else , though . __eou__
it 's actually ubuntu support , since i'm using ubuntu , isn't it ? __eou__
http://askubuntu.com/questions/29553/how-can-i-configure-unity __eou__
**unknown** , it 's very neat looking . Certainly more attractive than Unity . But it all depends on if you can get into the workflow that it 's designed for . __eou__ Valid point . :-) __eou__
is there unalocated space ? __eou__ adjacent __eou__
have fun with your server :-) __eou__
whats the linux equivalent of a batch file ? a . sh ? __eou__
nope . I dont touch wubi at all .. __eou__
How do I make sure that the CPU fan is running fine . __eou__ Please excuse me . Just got on a call . __eou__
the hud code is split between unity and indicator-appmenu __eou__
Thanks __eou__
not slower , but more prone to problems **unknown** . I have a lot of systems . I tend to stick with 32 bit and the PAE kernel if needed . __eou__
You have found what exactly ? 64-bit tends to be slower and use more memory ? __eou__ Do you have > 4 GiB ? __eou__
l3top is right . There is a learning curve you will have to get over for vim . Go for gedit until you get better at it . __eou__ troll level 7 ;) __eou__
Okay __eou__
i hope i understood __eou__ i've already installed pastebinit __eou__
i dont know how to use it ... i only know it 's the right thing to use . __eou__
you're right , that doesnt help at all . __eou__ i disabled compositing in unity 2d and it seems to be runing faster . not as pretty though . __eou__ are you familiar with xorg , xedgers __eou__ nm . __eou__
Dasda , I'm not hibernating at all . It appears to happen on any screen lock , even if it 's just a 10-minute later monitor blank __eou__ thanks , looking now __eou__
Its an old dell inspiron . I can boot a live cd of ubuntu on it , but do you know if theres anything I could put it to use for ? __eou__
I just came in , mind repeating your issue ? __eou__
true that __eou__
u actually should use the SSID __eou__
thanks for answer . i'm going to install official catalyst driver ( I need it) . there 's a simple way to back up my xorg settings before install it ? ( if something goes wrong ) __eou__
: Thanks . Im just looking at my new conky install and it seems like it 's a bit high to just idle __eou__
so you just say that nothing can't go wrong , ubuntu will start X also with wrong fglrx installation .... __eou__
then if you mount a reduced array set , it has be usable depending on the RAID type .. ( like you have the least requirements met ) __eou__ you can install on a reduced array set and then add harddrives later .. __eou__ but you'll have to see /dev/md0# for " / " first .. __eou__ you don't install to /dev/sda1 or something like .. always /dev/md# ... __eou__ you don't install to /dev/sda1 or something like like that .. BUT always something like-> /dev/md# ... __eou__ you'd use not the standard desktop iso of course __eou__
yes I do __eou__
Make java and chromium work properly __eou__

bcast will always be . 255 __eou__
so I don't need to install it , I just change the shell __eou__ rypervenche thanks guys __eou__
thats not the case . drop the attitude __eou__
If you are talking about /etc/profile & co , those are only read when you log in __eou__
hmm .. right .. intuitions and instincts sometimes work better than commands :D __eou__
I'm trying out the commands you told me earlier __eou__
ntop is not available in Main . __eou__ I am looking for software available in Main . __eou__
If you use Opera , set the browsers to mask as Internet Explorer ( right click - site preferences ) __eou__ It will then allow you to download the . exe file . __eou__
no , the share is guest=yes __eou__ in /etc/mtab ? __eou__
So the question arises if there is an interface to that device in the kernel . __eou__
does it list battery life ? __eou__
then you also know we can't support you __eou__
rsnapshot does something similar to " versioning " using rsnyc , but i doubt it is want you want __eou__
this may interest you http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/oscar-winning-video-editor-lightworks-landing-on-linux-in-october __eou__

ok , first of all : are you writing from the " bad " operating system , or the " good " one ? __eou__ argh , then it won't be as easy as I tought __eou__ you need a live cd in this case __eou__
thanks __eou__
I'm installing it now __eou__
yes they said its the common name . but i put the same and its not working :( __eou__

I think I figured it out . I am using the AMD Catalyst Control Center to set it up right now . __eou__
Unlikely . I have a fair understanding of the whole process , and have mucked around with **unknown** . I'm just hoping someone knows of an application that 's available for Linux that handles it . __eou__ Not sure if there 's something in the main repos that I just can't find . __eou__
i installed a fresh copy of ubuntu 12.04 after that i installed amd grafic card and after that i upgraded the sistem , when i rebootet the grafical enviroment want start , i'm on win machine now __eou__
yeah , i'll be sure to be careful , and disconnecting the hds is actually a good idea __eou__
is it ubuntu-related ? __eou__
what is install . sh ? __eou__
looks **unknown** maybe try the full path to vncserver __eou__
where can I get it ? __eou__
Ah . Didn't know about #ubuntu+1 , thanks . My connection isn't that fast so I wouldn't even download it . Also I want to test native . VM 's always seem to bring out the worst in linux distros ... __eou__
i'm on ext4 would that work ? __eou__
Please file a bug report about that then . __eou__
basic math in shell is enclosed in **unknown** . But only basic stuff , devision doesn't work . __eou__

np , i think im gonna grab some sleep then , and let it do its thing , ill continue tommorrow __eou__ worse comes to worse , ill install crashplan , backup the video files , and reinstall everything , then restore from crashplan __eou__
I would recommend you read up on checkinstall instead of blindly just using it . __eou__

You're welcome :) __eou__
u can force the xorg . conf configs to a sertain value __eou__ I strongly recommend u check xorg . conf docs __eou__ also it is important that the monitor has been pluged at boot , coz sometimes the automatic detection with the GUI does not work properly __eou__
first I install virtual box __eou__
Joe1 you can use the mini . iso or netinstall __eou__ the alternate installer will fit on cd __eou__
No problem . Both exist btw . __eou__
PC 1 = Lubuntu PC 2 = W7 ; Share in PC2 is NTFS , mounted in PC1 thru smbfs , CIFS in fstab __eou__

So the Windows 7 RDP client can connect to teamviewer ? the reason I need this setup is because I can't install additional software on my work system without going through a massive pile of red-tape but they all have the default Win 7 RDP client __eou__
ahhhh i remember reading somthing about that __eou__
I set my WOL parameters in BIOS , not sure if this really helps but is there a way you could use some generic driver from the kernel with the BIOS options set ? Maybe my system just works with the default drivers tho :/ __eou__
will do , Thanks ! __eou__
upgrade should be offered with 12.04 . 1 comes out . __eou__
Yes , but the mini iso will actually work with unetbootin , last I checked the server iso will not . __eou__
So no need to enable the backports repo ? __eou__
Why didn't you use apt-get ? __eou__
**unknown** 0.0 . **unknown** __eou__
ah ok __eou__
Ok , will try . __eou__ No , does not work either . __eou__
You are right , you can install anything . It 's the bare minimum to use the ubuntu distribution . __eou__
Yeah __eou__
Yeah , I want server . __eou__
sorry - i don't know the ubuntu-specific instructions for 3 . x and lucid ( i'm still happily running 2.6 . 32 __eou__

yeah it didn't work for me everytime i run the command to wrap i get an error __eou__
Many Upnp servers specically state they have Xbox360/PS3 support __eou__ If you like XBMC , check out PLEX . its a fork of xbmc with some neat features . __eou__
You mean in like ... the system settings and whatnot ? __eou__
there isn't a task manager like windows __eou__ you can use top or htop to view running processes and kill them __eou__
bobweaver or just disable the ppa in Softwace Center , Edit , Sources .... you people like to make the easy hard ;) __eou__
so after **unknown** , did you try just partitioning and no formatting ? __eou__
very cool thanks __eou__
my terminal just got WEIRD __eou__
yes , read the first answer , you need to createa file in **unknown** 2.0 **unknown** to override the default settings __eou__
It is ! __eou__ It is ? __eou__
nope just ubuntu , but i worked fine __eou__
cdrom worked fine on windows . __eou__ i dont think it has anything to do with the buring process , cds work fine on my desktop and my other ubuntu lap __eou__
ok , so the other box needs to be set up as a server , openssh or ftp ? __eou__ I can ssh into the box . __eou__

its not my home folder - it 's a different drive __eou__
now i'm at work but when i will get home i will try to do like u said __eou__

multiple , I tried debian 6 and backtrack ( what I had on hand ) __eou__
and one of the cheapest ones too ! **unknown** for 1155 socket :) __eou__ with B75 ( 3rd gen i3 , 5 , 7 ) support __eou__

somsip : wrong channel soz __eou__
then you are in the right place , welcome __eou__ unfortunately i can't really help you since i know nothing of evolution or thunderbird __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ yep __eou__ IIRC , make is in build-essential , so i might have noticed :) __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
small suggestion : create a regular account for daily use and leave the admin for admin tasks . I'm in xubuntu , but I'm pretty sure there 's a setting that will require password to mount drives . Don't know where though . __eou__
I'm trying to **unknown** dbmail , and they suggested that . I can't get it to compile . __eou__
Also , check if it requires PIN and if so you can use a onother supported OS to disaple PIN prompt . Also , check usb_modeswitch if it tells you its a HDD . __eou__
will try that __eou__
thanx for help __eou__
I have to backup , etc . I want to clean install . for now , I just want to use this package . __eou__
I don't think I undertstand the requirements . Why do you need the password of that specific user for it ? Would you not check if < user > is member of a specific group . To check the user 's password you would passwd ? That may not be feasable in Qt nor CLI . __eou__
Not sure . __eou__
I am short on toilet paper , any suggestion ? __eou__
I missed that part of your thread . I referred to Great Firewall of China __eou__
I found this , but I can't seem to find anything else http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android __eou__ It 's made me very curious __eou__
**unknown** ? Oh right __eou__
aha ! ok , I'll go off and google backports :) I can use a package which is in hardy that way ? __eou__
python is easy as __eou__ I learned php and perl before 18 , learning python was even easier at 24 :) __eou__ well it is similar but different , a block of code is determined by indentation instead of using { } __eou__
They accept bitcoins __eou__
exploit Google AdSense using inject JavaScript and RCP ping backs ? __eou__
I'm all set for now . Unless you wanna help me run an xsession in my LCD track pad on my laptop __eou__
perhaps ask in #irssi __eou__ finch __eou__
Yeah it would probably help others . I'm thinking it 's down to my hardware at this junction , however the input/output errors I've managed to dig up seem to be correlated with bad HDDs , but this is the only command I've had this come up with __eou__
install the package , choose from login window __eou__

thank you , btw the game is Warzone2100 __eou__
I've done that a few times , it still has the same error . __eou__
ok __eou__
No probs , its not something I've tried , so can't suggest anything __eou__
will do , thanks __eou__

transmission __eou__
here is a video demo of the phone . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyeFcldavTk just so you can see that it is not just a desktop __eou__
and i was just trying to point you to the official docs giving pretty much infos about current packages in the current lts release . wish you good luck with the screen setup ;) __eou__
ok , thanks , maybe I will do that __eou__ I wanted a minimal install anyway __eou__
it used to open firefox which allowed me to open transmission __eou__
TJ- : that makes sense , though this laptop has a dedicated video card . unfortunately , it uses EFI rather than BIOS , so i don't think there 's a way to disable the shared video memory __eou__

Okay thanks for the advice =D __eou__

I have been reading up about it and tried what most people have succsses with but no such luck for me __eou__
I'm not going to argue over petty scripts or themes . You win . __eou__
you can add more in the compizconfig settings manager which needs installing as far as right to left or left to right I'm not sure . __eou__ you could set up a 8 sided cube and use the flat out function to go between dektopd maybe , I stopped using unity a while back though . __eou__

Will give it a try __eou__ seems to be working out __eou__
i don't know sorry __eou__
well everytime I load my IRC it has saved #ubuntu #smuxi how do I add wine to this list ? __eou__
you aren't using ubuntu so you aren't supported here in any way __eou__
forget i ever mentioned i am using some derivative . can i know how to install ubuntu software center from apt-get , if i am using THE ubuntu ? __eou__
then at least change the ident , else you won't get into #winehq __eou__
because it has been showing fine for the last 4 weeks :) it has samba and was happy to serve my win7 as external hd :) __eou__
roger I'll head there __eou__
np :) __eou__ yes , LTS to LTS is fully supported __eou__ also run : sudo apt-get clean __eou__ there is a fork of Gnome2 , its not suported here though __eou__ **unknown** __eou__ personally I'd use XFCE and get full support __eou__
seem to solve the problem , thanks __eou__
not if you are talking to them , that is the whole point of highlighting __eou__ even 10.04 is supported longer than 11.04 __eou__
I am a sysadmin . I have plenty of Lucid users , and I already have a Precise image . I am looking for today , not the future . __eou__
but " conffiles " are not only foo . conf nits a debian technic __eou__
/join #freenode ask there __eou__
dpkg -- reconfigure is the only way i'd realize .. but i might lack the knowledge so verify __eou__
off the top of my head - sorry i don't... i set it up once in my irssi config , and don't have to worry about it again __eou__
yeah __eou__ but I should be able to install the package for **unknown** ? __eou__ onto precise __eou__
it will break your OS , debian and ubuntu packages are not to be mixed __eou__ the PPA I gave will install oracle java for you and java will work __eou__

i love ubuntu , with an old computer ... but nothing works , chat or youtube or anything :-( __eou__
www.youtube.com/html5 __eou__
oops , you caught me ; I'm not having problems myself , I'm trying to find out if anyone else here is :) because **unknown** is telling us that there is a frequent problem but we don't quite have enough information to reproduce it __eou__
o.k. __eou__

ActionParsnip wanted you to try using wget to download a a large file from a known fast server , ( I would argue that cdimage.ubuntu.com was a bad choice in that respect ) so he chose an Ubuntu iso . The file itself isn't important . __eou__
You can ; t hear anything or what ? __eou__
specifically I've tried : sudo aptitude install **unknown** 5.6 . 6-2 as the release I see is 5.6 . 6-2 but aptitude is unable to find the version specified . When I run aptitude versions the only version displaying is 6.0 . 1 __eou__
hopefully , I just installed it and it didn't look like it was running , but perhaps it will at boot __eou__
that is ! in fact i downloaded two , one is audiveris , the otherone is **unknown** __eou__ but thei're both based in java or something like that , it 's sounds like chinese to me __eou__
I usually don't **unknown** movies through the terminal :P __eou__
anyone who can help me here ? definitely , it would be great if i will not capture everything by setting -s 0 __eou__
Next time it happens , look immediately before you try anything ... logs are our friends ! __eou__
we dont know what its _not_ detecting , maybe the partition table ? maybe it is broken ? __eou__
otherwise , look in the files in /etc/apt/sources . list . **unknown** __eou__
just tcpdump . __eou__ i am having some confusion in using tcpdump and the right capture filter and snaplen to use . i want to sniff all udp and tcp traffic except http and write it to a pcap file using the -w option but i am only interested on the following information : access_time | src_ipaddr | src_port | dst_ipaddr | dst_port | svc_name | protocol | upload_size | download_size __eou__
I am out of here :P __eou__
How do I find what driver I am using ? __eou__ Or chipset , even ? __eou__
Yea !! but I see blank screen Only !! no text to debug what is going on ! __eou__ I did that __eou__
wat CPU do you have and how much RAM and what is the system for ? __eou__ install 64bit Ubuntu __eou__ you can resize your NTFS in Windows __eou__ then install to the freed space __eou__ I'd go for 12.04 , it 's the latest release and is also LTS ( supported until 2017 ) __eou__ make sure you MD5 test the ISO you download __eou__

Let me know when you've tried everything else , then I'll tell you how to fix it . __eou__
- the XFCE is starting OK via the vncserver DIY daemon ( as detailed by the earlier link) , with out the need for X to actually be running on the host 's own TTY __eou__ what 's odd is that ~/ . **unknown** loaded when I SSH into the VM , but not on the VNC terminals themselves ..... __eou__

I'm using wired connection right now . I was testing the Quantal kernel when I did the update . Rfkill showed my card is hard blocked . __eou__
It wasn't my comment to you . I was just echoing it for you . If you're on 12.04 you will get 12.04 updates . If you want 12.10 updates , you need to run 12.10 . There may be a PPA that backports 12.10 updates to 12.04 but YMMV __eou__
yes , using the live CD and investigating the filessystems on your hard disks . __eou__
thanks , will do __eou__
but its the same ubuntu , just a different package configuration ? I was wondering how it is that xubuntu has a different LTS support length if its just different packages __eou__ ^ __eou__

scripts in this dir will be executed by run-parts when network-ifaces come up __eou__
you're likely having conflicts between them now . and you'll need to chown the directory to the new uid __eou__
im sure I do why __eou__
what ? __eou__
i think that 's false . especially if you have an additional drive to back up to before repartitioning . __eou__
no such file x-x __eou__

that and if the Update Manager tells you that there is a new version out . __eou__
i have used unity on my dads desktop __eou__
If you are running 10.04 . x , then you won't be offered 12.04 until the update-manager package for 10.04 has been updated to detect it ( which is likely to be on/after the 12.04 . 1 release date ) __eou__

ty __eou__
that 's it , thanks . __eou__
i couldnt solve the problem . but i think its caused by the too weak onboard-chip __eou__
No , that is not possible . The application can't work because it can't be displayed *anywhere* . __eou__ You can just install Xorg ( apt-get install xorg ) and a small window manager such as fluxbox ( **unknown** -- No need for a full desktop environment such as Gnome , KDE or XFCE . __eou__

I found the download location for Kubuntu , but now the question is - why does Ubuntu recommend using 32bit ? I know my computer can use 64bit ? __eou__
Sorry , my network has just hung out :( __eou__
possible with mrtg __eou__
Good luck ! __eou__
http://askubuntu.com/questions/81344/how-to-fix-error-with-ati-driver-error-of-failed-request __eou__ why is this happening to me now __eou__
no way __eou__
sorry , don't know enough about the PAE kernel to help any further . thanks for introducing me to something new . good luck __eou__
testing with non-pae is an idea but vista at the same laptop see 4G __eou__
removing compiz is a bad idea when you want to use compiz :/ __eou__ and gnome-classic is a very cut-off desktop . its just a fallback thingy which is gonna be dropped anyways in next releases __eou__ im not sure if the alt+tab thing on gnome-classic uses compiz . since you deleted compiz that could be the issue __eou__
so when i run gparted off a cd , do i just right click /dev/sda5 ( or /dev/sda4 which ' opens up ' to show sda4 ) and extend that and leave the swap aprtition well alone ? thanks __eou__
thanks for the links but im just gonna drive on ahead and see what happens , got all my data backed up __eou__
which is not the ubuntu-way :/ __eou__
you should have set a root password when you installed it __eou__
wait .... so if i shut down mint after a suspend/hibernate , then boot from ubuntu is that a problem ? __eou__
I don't know exactly where you do it during install , but later on you can change /etc/fstab __eou__
ah , that 's different , no advice on bandwidth , tho __eou__
then press shift when booting __eou__
but 304.37 is the STABLE driver that is officially supported by Nvidia __eou__
it 's alt prt screen __eou__ alt prt screen places the screenshot in the ~/Pictures folder __eou__
If I use the X-Swat PPA to install the driver , will I avoid having to resintall the driver manually after each update of Open GL libraries and such ? __eou__
Guess he/she told me .. ;-( __eou__
Just figured I'd mention it . :) __eou__
I'm not a native speaker . __eou__ Yeah , it just change the permission of the directory . __eou__
no idea . If you messed up the xchat settings . you could move/rename your . xchat2 directory and restart Xchat and it should use the default settings __eou__
I don't exactly know the difference . __eou__
iirc , Wine requires 32bit packages on 64bit installs , so it can be rather common . __eou__
Is your package list new enough ? __eou__ aptitude search ' **unknown** ' __eou__
because I hate doing this whole Nvdia -- sanity check reinstall dance ... __eou__
that 's the problem is that support in Windows is flawless __eou__

check the ftp logs in /var/log __eou__
Oh I see . Work computer __eou__

maybe i downloaded the x64 one __eou__
re xorg . conf . I just want to understand what the server is being asked to do __eou__
you have some guide how to set up rp-pppoe ? __eou__
thanks , it works . __eou__
guess you have to ! register first __eou__
that is a #freenode issue . not an ubuntu issue __eou__
don't use that word here , please __eou__
i use 10.04 __eou__
You have two gpus ? One intel and one nvidia ? And you cannot disable the onboard in bios ? __eou__
thanx !! __eou__
The Pause button is NOT closing the program . __eou__ Ctrl-Q has no response to the program . I don't know why . __eou__
dirty work-around : use a live-cd , go to our harddrive , search mfc4800lpr on it and delete , then go back to your normal ubuntu and perform sudo apt-get autoremove __eou__ *your harddrive __eou__
if it 's already installed , then no __eou__
so the harddrive is broken ? __eou__
its a WD on an AsusTek MB its almost 3 years or more old __eou__
can you pastebin your /etc/network/interface ?? __eou__ can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces ?? __eou__
this is all I see about nvidia __eou__ not sure why it has a wrong date ... __eou__
I'm going to do a reinstall , maybe even upgrading to the second-newest distro out . What is it now , 13 . x ? __eou__
no I did not __eou__
do any gnome shell extensions work with ubuntu ? __eou__
vi __eou__
which ubuntu are you using and can you put the whole command and message into a pastebin ? __eou__ ! ask | BrokeN_ __eou__
lol thanks the way my twinview was working I had no gear so I had to turn off the second monitor __eou__
**unknown** , thanks ... __eou__
Okay I mean the unity applications menu thingy ... What 's it called ? I want to say " Start Menu " ... __eou__ The " dash " ... I want WhatPulse to appear in the Dash __eou__ Also I would like to edit the parameters of certain entries in " dash " applications ... like the icon and the command line parameters when I click the " xchat " button in there __eou__
fresh install = new install __eou__
where do i get the log file viewer __eou__
in this link they say " To upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04 , you must now use the Alternate CD upgrade method . Or you can use : sudo do-release-upgrade -d " __eou__
TJ - So now Network-Manager is managing it - but we're not connected . __eou__
so it 's a mac , it 's not a regular pc , that 's why i asked __eou__
if i uninstall fakeraid , will i still be able to dual boot if i want to ? __eou__
yes , i did . it doesn't find the arch system . then i saw a tip on internet , about have the arch partition mounted and just then do that command __eou__
1 . Erin I bought this and put it in my torrents folder , happy ? __eou__ 2 . Why cp ? I want to move , not copy __eou__
i means you don't need to install a specific driver ( 90+% of the time , some of the new intel stuff seems to give some issues ) __eou__
haven't done that yet because I thought it was related to something else - that 's the first thing I should have done ... thanks :-) __eou__
it is a dhcp connection I don't specify anything __eou__ I am using network manager , If I just manage the connections manually in /etc/network/interfaces and leave the inet part out of one of them will that work ?? __eou__
Why would you even give that option . __eou__
next to the output volume bar , is it switched on ? __eou__
give people this link when they ask my question **unknown** __eou__
almost ;) __eou__
I have seen that page , it didn't help :( __eou__
fair enough . and I guess my use case is a little strange , since I usually wind up doing that over a network ... __eou__
cant find it __eou__
what is the default chmod ? 644 ? __eou__ david_ , same args ? /from/* /to/ __eou__ think i broke the permissions :p **unknown** : ~$ cp -a /var/torrents/* /media/external/TV\ Shows/ __eou__
I think I just figured it out . 2015 gave the wrong symbol ... it expects hex not dex __eou__ **unknown** __eou__ So I guess < **unknown** , **unknown** , < enter > __eou__
Couldn't I just install some package instead ? __eou__ ok , but it 's really a big project to install kubuntu-desktop again ... __eou__
sure , but you could have deleted files that other programs are depending on that you already have installed __eou__ but yeah , you could just try reinstalling packages when things error __eou__
at one time ( before i ditched google sites ) ! controls links to my **unknown** ( google sites page ) for instructions i got ( from #ubuntu+1 ) when lucid was in beta ;) __eou__
Thank you ;-) __eou__
but when I try it for indicator-applet , it tells me it 's not installed . __eou__
in java , find the last "."? the function " **unknown** () " is only find the string from left __eou__ ! text file ? __eou__
ok thanks , pretty much already did that . Maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way ... get 12.04 installed then maybe theres something that sets up a dev environment ? __eou__
maybe the boot device order in BIOS is picking that secondary drive to boot from ? __eou__ that'll be it then __eou__
yes , there is __eou__
- try using grub-customizer __eou__
no he doesnt . __eou__ he , himself and hehe __eou__
thats not what you said , you were talking as if my router is actually doing that and it doesnt __eou__
can wibu install to a new partition using the windows bootloader ? __eou__ as opposed to installing on the windows partition __eou__ what is a reasonable swap partition size ? __eou__
what kind of virtual network do you have ? __eou__
ubuntu-restricted-extras are not included by default ; but why would this cause reinstallation ? __eou__
ok :( __eou__ thanks anyway __eou__ well ... it 's simply ignoring the keyboard completely on the login screen . the endless returns only start if I activate the onscreen keyboard and login with that __eou__ after the login , endless returns . before , ignoring the keystrokes , even ctrl+alt+f1 to try and go to tty __eou__ if I login with a guest session , there 's no endless returns , but no keyboard either __eou__ just to let you I solved it . I made the wrong assumption that modifying the nvidia-current . conf file on xord . con **unknown** wouldn't affect my normal Xorg since it 's using the integrated graphics , and set AutoAddDevices to false . changed that and the keyboard is back . ( the endless returns are probably a side effect of typing my password with the onscreen keyboard , I guess the last stroke - return - never sends a ' key up ' event because of the login proces __eou__ s it starts ) __eou__
patience . asking more often does not get a quicker answer __eou__
Yeah , the four pages I've hit in half an hour weren't enough to explain that . __eou__
True , I tried 12.04 and most of the times the computer hangs during shut down process __eou__

yes __eou__
VLC will also knock the screensaver timeout off :) __eou__ its not in the wine appdb but considering the amount of native players for Linux why do you want to hold onto power dvd ??? __eou__ sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install libdvdread4 ; sudo **unknown** . sh ; sudo apt-get upgrade __eou__ you are free to try it in wine but I doubt it will work . Don't forget that linux is a completely different OS with differnet drivers and display methods __eou__ so you are going to run both Windows and Linux at the same time for the sake of a DVD playback app ....? __eou__
what package ? __eou__
wubi __eou__
i'll try it right away __eou__ thank you very much !! it works ... i've downloaded it just now and it works .. __eou__
I would load up a virtual machine ( virtualbox kvm vmware ) and blow things up in there . __eou__
I did that , all that remains is restart ? :D __eou__
Will do . Gimmie a sec to type . :p __eou__
+1 means we agree with you __eou__
okay , I'm writing there now , just thought I could stay around when I got help . :) __eou__
exactly __eou__
sorry I'm new here , what is that +number __eou__ :) __eou__
you can add the drive to your fstab file to auto mount it , also disk manager can mount it as well __eou__
this is the result of the code u gave me lspci | grep VGA : 00:02 . 0 VGA compatible controller : Intel Corporation N10 Family Integrated Graphics Controller __eou__ well I was not sure cause its like Windows 7 works faster then Ubuntu in this netbook . I am so confused . I am afraid of having something wrong . Like running ubuntu in wrong way or something imported is missing dunno . __eou__ been used old version for a month but the last version is since yesterday __eou__ can I do anything with mint that I do in ubuntu ? __eou__
That 's the thing , my computer doesn't like booting from the flash drive , and we can't get a CD to burn properly . __eou__
hardware __eou__ try swaping the sata cable __eou__ *ports __eou__
ok , thanx __eou__
Good off-site backup that I use and like , is CrashPlan . __eou__
thanks . I would like to have all my **unknown** intact , though __eou__ meaning , I would be booting from a 32 or 64 bit kernel , but the desktop would be the same __eou__ I don't know if that 's now it works , though . __eou__
why do you need tor ? __eou__
yep just make , what error do you get ? __eou__
yeah , nobodys fault . I didnt meant to be a jerk about it __eou__
then you'll want to stick to 32 , since it will work on both __eou__
I will try it all with USB drive . __eou__ no will try now but what is this sudo-apt-get lxde-desktop __eou__
no /proc/acpi either __eou__ huh ? o.o __eou__ oh , **unknown** __eou__
needed to make sure :-) __eou__ in that case , if you have ubuntu format your entire drive ... it will delete everything that was there previously __eou__
just added it myself , I have an apt-get group :) __eou__
please pastebin what is in your /etc/apt/sources . list __eou__ how did you install it ? __eou__
atheros , but internal yes __eou__
i did __eou__
No , 4 servers run as my hypervisors for servers . the 2 remaining are SAN servers . __eou__
then why are you saying to do it ? : V __eou__ **unknown** know what , I'm just going to test this . __eou__
Well it uses between **unknown** - 45 of CPU __eou__ what do u mean with : **unknown** : if you install Xubuntu , Kubuntu or Lubuntu it won't even be installed __eou__
I don't see how reinstalling is faster than `sudo chown -R $USER ~` :P __eou__
i mean reinstall your ubuntu __eou__
how ? __eou__
seriously pulse is basically hot to do audio __eou__ s/hot/how/ __eou__
let me try __eou__ before doing this is there a TAsk Mgr that I can see CPU and RAM usages __eou__
As I said , for Wine support , your channel is #winehq __eou__ As I said , for Wine support , your channel is #winehq __eou__
by youruser do you mean of the old account or the account I just made to run that command on __eou__
if you're getting a permission-denied as root , I honestly don't know what to tell **unknown** __eou__
Im not ignoring someone 's help ... im just trying to follow the instructions you gave me ... Fixing the USB wasn't what you said ? Man , we're completly missunderstanding each other :/ __eou__
Yeah ... Still the worst idea in history . And I support a lot of what Canonical does , with the exceptions of Unity . __eou__
how about virtualbox type thing with osx on ? or same problems ? __eou__
Which still doesn't make sense . __eou__
Ubuntu 12.04 __eou__ Ubuntu 12.04 __eou__
I understand that you cannot move your terminal without your mouse . __eou__
bash : crc32 : command not found __eou__
so grub can install to a single drive ? __eou__
ping __eou__
you may need to uninstall the proprietary driver , reboot using the open driver then reinstall it __eou__
sg0 & sr0 is the burner __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1154327/ - first is for unplug and three after plugging , I think __eou__
it 's not me it 's ubuntu __eou__
yes , ntfs is an ass like taht __eou__
this is a public channel , you're expected to give all useful details of a problem and any one may help __eou__
What 's the ubuntu IRC channel to signal this to Ubuntu admins so that they bring http://kernel.ubuntu.com/ up again ? __eou__
sorry , i want to remove these features all together - more like an apt-get purge blah-package __eou__
so like /ignore ' has joined ' will work ? __eou__
so I'll save it as a . **unknown** or something ... and to restore , just boot from Live CD and do ' dd if=BackupImage of =/ dev/sda1 ' ?? __eou__
Well that sucks ... I just recently came back to Linux after about 6 years , I was planning on compiling my kernel soon ( since I've noticed some cpu issues ) __eou__ exactly , so a custom compiled cpu would be able to utilize your specific hardware properly . __eou__
haha ... cool site ... lemme check __eou__
there is a check box during install =) np __eou__
Does Ctrl+alt+F1 allow me to move the window with the help of arrow keys ? __eou__ ( sounds stupid to ask but I don't have a DE like Unity or GNOME3 . __eou__
already have too many customizations to go that route __eou__
I can't tell you but there shoudl be one . Given that your system is in production I recommend to backup and even dd your OS partitions prior any upgrade . __eou__
xset m ? yeah playing with it now __eou__ it actually seems more precise vertically __eou__
That 's somethign I can't answer . I would assume it is well a political decision made by canonical . __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
Thanks W4sp . __eou__ :) __eou__ I was thinking on the same lines as a router programmable . Perhaps a CISCO router . __eou__
at least we are on the same page . I was thinking on the same line of thinking . __eou__
pulse audio ? this is a video prob __eou__
cheers __eou__

did you see the same problem ? __eou__
am not certain that is the personal intention __eou__
so 64mb would be **unknown** ? __eou__
who 's recommendation is that ? I've been running 12.04 ( **unknown** on several machines with no issues . __eou__
something like " for critical installation , it is recommended you stay on 10.04 until first point release of 12.04 " do't have link handy __eou__
Can someone please help me ? Whoever told me to plug an ethernet cable into my laptop and the other end into my desktop , please PM me __eou__ for some reason it keeps popping up with " Wired network Disconnected " __eou__ it keeps trying __eou__
Will do . __eou__
You don't get it !!! It says to go into Ubuntu Software Center ... how is that possible if I can't connect to the internet on my desktop ? I am on the IRC on my LAPTOP __eou__
I'm guessing a really old crappy **unknown** ? then your f'd until they fix the intel-driver :( __eou__
thats why i said sort of . it CAN be done , but it is a terrible idea . __eou__
nvidia too ? __eou__
I get an error when I do that . " validation error : data incomplete in file /etc/x11/xorg . **unknown** section " Default Device " must have a Driver line ." __eou__
all the search results I find for 12.04 are about the server edition __eou__
haven't figured out how to do that . __eou__ have a page on that ? __eou__
thanks xangua __eou__
You will probably be okay it just takes awhile to resize that much . __eou__ generally yes , you have to just try really __eou__
hank you __eou__ thank you __eou__
thats what i figured , but personally i doubt that the ops will get mad at me since that wasnt really trolling , that was just a light joke . and im here forn support , just like the other people here . some of the ops may even recognize me as a long time member , but then again , knowing my luck , they may not . if you took offence to it , i apologize sincerely __eou__ have you tried an older version of ubuntu ? i am using 10.04 LTS , and have never had any problems with it . since its been out longer , its had more time to had the bugs ironed out . you might want to give it a try , although unfortunantly , support will br terminated in 2013 __eou__ are you using a server edition ? __eou__
True , I'm sorry xD __eou__
/dev/sda is her internal HDD . /dev/sdc is the external one where we want to install Ubuntu . __eou__
I have no problems with my ram :) __eou__
you may want to reboot to the newer kernel , then remove the other 2 kernels . You will get about 240Mb back __eou__
usb stick ? __eou__ lol i knw what a usb drive is :P .... i was asking why i need one ? __eou__ do i need to install windows drivers or there are seperate ones for ubuntu ? __eou__
no shit :P __eou__ +1 :D __eou__
I see . Thanks tim . hmmm . __eou__
and how to do that ? __eou__
okay . __eou__
ok crating user is pretty easy __eou__
lol , software for Linux ( any linux distro ) is in online repositories , of course you have to be online . __eou__ ok ... good luck w/ your problem then .. you obviously have it all figured out __eou__ i understand exactlywhat you rproblem is .. YOU don't understand what your problem is __eou__ just curious , how did you install the driver for that device before ? __eou__
kinda both ... __eou__ two tabs to the left should be another input/output screen __eou__
I just want a messenger that will let me reply easily from the notification __eou__
none that I can recommend at the top of my head ... but there are *lots* of good HW-books :) __eou__
not sure ; this is on a PowerBook G4 . __eou__ okay , how do I upgrade ? XD __eou__
yeah .. you would think __eou__
Well actually now i'm switching to Google chrome because chromium isn't being build anymore __eou__
thanks ! __eou__ works perfectly love you ! __eou__
install Ubuntu from a **unknown** . The computer in question has a broken internal ( optical ) disc drive , though , so ... __eou__
i have it but i only wanted it because it has zoneminder in it __eou__
thanks __eou__
sorry , typing slow . I am on an Acer 4755 with wireless N . My router has dualband Wireless N capability . I just dont know how to get the wireless N type speeds i am expecting __eou__
if you have /no/ privileges on the server , how are you logging in ? ;) __eou__
yes . the restricted extras are installed and all updates applied __eou__
in NetworkManager __eou__
thanks . that 's not what i am expecting . let me finish tinkering with the wireless N setup on my router . perhaps the router is not using the right channel or something __eou__
thanks . where did you see the router claim ? __eou__ i have been playing and will reboot my router soon . seems 40mhz wasnt active and bunch of other things , so probably not an Ubuntu issue . __eou__
I'm just trying __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1155046/ __eou__
He has not network cable , a broken optical driver , and only Wifi connection from Windows . Short of pulling the HDD and attaching it to another PC , installing via wubi first then using wubi to bootstrap into a raw HDD install seems the only option __eou__
because __eou__
but yes . select the recovery entry on grub . and then try that command . BUT before all that i would recommend you to boot up a live-system ( usb or cd ) and backup your data __eou__
have fun , be safe __eou__
if no one knows ..... __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ Fair enough . __eou__ The entire thing is not round , **unknown** __eou__
doesn't the Wubi installer have an option to do that ? __eou__
thanks . any idea of how i can test throughput ? __eou__
What I see after I reboot is a different user login password screen ( blue color ) and its shows me a dark screen after I login . Thats all . __eou__ There is no screen that i can choose the desktop environment . __eou__
: yes :) i upgraded __eou__
: like ? __eou__
sorry let me state my problem again . I had a very clean Ubuntu 12.04 LTS then I tried to use OpenBox . I went " Logout " then Choose OpenBox . This user login window popup . Then a dark ( gray ) screen and nothing more . __eou__
You have to buy it . __eou__
TJ- , alright I am searching for the instructions I followed to install them in the first place __eou__
thank u __eou__
When I work in OS X , it 's always off . __eou__
I can see all my home files though still __eou__
live cd , or usb , or boot linux to the console/text/recovery mode __eou__
Correct . __eou__ In a pastebin please . __eou__
the issue is that there are a lot of lines , I'll have to comment each line it 's not so good __eou__
ifconfig|head -2 __eou__
using Additional Drivers __eou__ : __eou__
my router is not allowing port 80 through public __eou__
yes thats how I installed my Nvidia Drivers __eou__
Not sure what to tell you then . I am using bonding so I don't get the normal network devices screen anymore . __eou__
;) i dont use vmware , or raids .. __eou__
so if I'm using 12.04 I can use unity 2d . I have grown quite attached to unity but my laptop I'd way to weak for that __eou__
yeah this was what I was asking Dr_Willis if this is a good idea __eou__ sudo apt-get install lxde __eou__ i think this is all i need to do __eou__
cool I'll check them out __eou__
Compiz wave effect is the reason I change from windows to linux __eou__
i have no idea what the installer used __eou__
what tools would i need ? __eou__ jockey doesn't find any proprietary drivers , so i figure i should be able to find something in synaptic __eou__ if nothing else i can build from source if i need to __eou__
Eh ... I would search for a Debian package ( or a PPA ) instead . __eou__ But yeah , you might be able to do it with the 32-bit libs __eou__
I tried the PPA on my current 12.4 install . It broke the qtcore package . __eou__
i run intel software raid ( fake raid ) __eou__
fine or you can just change the permission by using chmod __eou__
Then it is not declared ( yet) . You can telnet/ssh into your machine by ' telnet < **unknown** > 8005 ' and see on < **unknown** > with the netstat command I gave you . __eou__ What prog gives you 101 ...? __eou__
thanks . I am trying 32g too . Maybe I need a faster flash drive __eou__
i use unity . not gnome-shell __eou__
install the nvidia-current package , or run jockey-text from a console perhaps __eou__
that 's problematic with -A -B and -C __eou__
Thanks __eou__
beautiful . thanks __eou__
Yeah I do know it but I installed it for educational purpose .. __eou__
i didnt change anything except to reboot __eou__
how do you know it hasn't? __eou__
via browser __eou__
: What do you mean related to Nokia ? Im using Qt which is a product of Nokia . So Im not sure what you meant . __eou__
do you know that they're related ? __eou__
that will get vers 2.2 I believe __eou__

np __eou__
you running wine ? __eou__ FOR THE . EXE __eou__ opps cap lock sorry __eou__
any way , as ubuntu is going to be graphical desktop , you should talk about it __eou__ yes . i know . i hope i can read about that new technology updating __eou__
Doesn't it seem like the question which version of Ubuntu is best for working with Audacity and Vlc is a valuable and needed question ? __eou__ Thank you . And yes I have tried them all and frankly I'm running out of time to dabble . I'm looking for things that work not a dabble around and look for things that don't __eou__
it doesn't, **unknown** being a bit paranoid . X3 __eou__
then I suggest you report a bug __eou__
and can I use Compiz in GNOME CLASSIC ? __eou__
switch cards , use both , use multi monitors ... i do it all with my 2 nvidia cards __eou__
You can set it to not turn off at all , that'd be in power management settings . As for the cube thing , I think that doesn't work with recent Ubuntu releases . __eou__
I'm not familiar with a NFS mounted home partition so not sure in regards to that and a boot partition , others should know though . __eou__
shouldn't that be **unknown** -a` ? __eou__
i'm sure regular USB is your best bet - but it 's slow ... live with it ;) it 's handy __eou__
I am not running at SATA HDD speed :) I am meeting the specifications of the manufacturer . __eou__
hum .. on OS X , disk utility can do this ... It may dismount the partition and do it 's magick .. bcoz the system freezes for a while while doin'g it :D __eou__ but thanks anyway __eou__
how have YOU installed webmin in a way that doesn't use SSL ? The deb package they provide always enables it . __eou__
pres your windows key __eou__ did you setup X with just gnome-panel launching ? __eou__ well is the unity panel still on the screen ? __eou__
alt + f2 ? __eou__ There are other more modular solutions like gnome-do that you might wanna look at too __eou__ gnome-do also looks for files and can index a lot more information like contents of emails , recent pidgin conversations , web pages , and similar __eou__ alt+f2 is ONLY programs __eou__
to search the index and not the actual fs __eou__
maybe a driver issue __eou__
ah okay __eou__
thanks __eou__
and Rallias : well LFD2 seems to be the first port . Well i own that game and it ain't any different from the first one and quite boring __eou__
No . __eou__
when i boot to windows it comes up , but grub loader doesn't show , so for linux there nothing __eou__
always . __eou__
there are gnome classic & gnome classic ( no effects ) ; wich do you think uses **unknown** __eou__
isn't lxde more ligher and faster then unity ? __eou__
pm ? __eou__ " cvlc < options > < stream > & " __eou__
when I ran disk utility , it had a grey icon , saying it wasn't communicating __eou__ & Rallias thanks , I'm gonna try some recovery fun . __eou__ I have no idea how fsck fixed it the first time __eou__
I'm not an idiot . Of course I can put them in the same folder ( they already are) . I need to combine them into one long video file . __eou__
did you try it by using echo ' command " my string "' | cat or with the real at command ? __eou__
OK , then it 's not chrooted , I suppose . Sorry . __eou__
you dont need it to be mounted for installing ubuntu onto another partition . :) __eou__
recovery __eou__ I'm not sure about backup __eou__
oh dear :( __eou__ The solution is clearly 4 disk raid 1 __eou__
exactly __eou__
I can't even get x to start right now because of the full disk __eou__
I see . I have no expertise i multi-media . Only advice would be to see what exception is thrown by the clients connecting to MPD . __eou__
how 's that the problem ? Huge log files ? __eou__
Back .... __eou__ My command is echo 200 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/panasonic/brightness and I can adjust brigtness on a scale from 0 to 254 . __eou__
How do I enable it ? __eou__
I see . To let me know the command line woudln't help then . I was wondering about your single and double quotes though ... There is #bash on FreeNode too . Maybe they can spot something . __eou__
I can run Ubuntu3D __eou__
W4sp : thks for the tips . So if I'm understanding correctly it seems there are two methods by which I may reach my goal ... ( 1 ) from the bare 12.04 server , use some deselect flag with apt-get ( first I've heard of that flag) . or ( 2 ) find a way to remove the ( whatever it is ) that wants to tell empathy when I'm online first - then go about removing the little extras I don't want . Is that on target ? __eou__ ssta : what are equivs ? __eou__
MoneyDust , W4sp I do have gnome-panel installed . This is how I logged in Gnome-Classic . Here > http://i45.tinypic.com/359ikvc.jpg __eou__
maybe I should give xubuntu another shot then __eou__
first you need to find the camera 's vendor :p **unknown** ID ... if it is a USB camera you can check what USB devices are connected using " lsusb " __eou__

do you know how I can do that __eou__
when im doubleclicking it , then it gives me back a window to choose the best program to run it with __eou__
proc is not a real filesystem , and is not really taking up disk space . It 's a convenience mechanism to get information from the kernel __eou__
That line should work in there ? Thanks . __eou__
sure I'm about to go pick up dinner tho __eou__
yes . __eou__ I used this instruction https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation __eou__
Almost every application can be used with a keyboard . If it gets too complicated just buy new batteries . __eou__

no idea . __eou__
ill use a machine wih guest session so no possibly to install w.e ;] __eou__ and maybe the usb port wont be enabled tho but ill see __eou__
ok .. most likely grub is getting put on the wrong disk , and thats why you're having this problem . __eou__
Yeah , me neither , I just got on the bandwagon and bought one recently . Thanks , though . __eou__
There were more search results when I found that . Is there nothing else out there ? __eou__
alright . I appreciate it __eou__
Sweet , thanks everyone . __eou__
i did a reinstall from my disk __eou__

dupclicity FTW __eou__ they are usually not that bad , I have been doing them since the Debian Slink days __eou__ yes __eou__ which is why I like to grab /etc/ /var/ and /usr/local seperately __eou__
you probably need to restart the panel , it will probably work next login __eou__ I have it here , so it is possible in theory __eou__
w/o 12.04 . 1 ? __eou__
although admittedly , past initial setup , i never use the webUI ... go figure . __eou__
no i've not tried that .. will do it and let you know .. thanks .. __eou__
this is really OT , __eou__
so I think just copy /home , /etc , /var and /usr ? __eou__
well , trying to upgrade 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS . But maybe I shouldn't even bother __eou__

why can't you ? __eou__ there is html5 __eou__ I don't have problems with flash or over heating so i'm not sure what you are doing with your system or the apps you are installing . __eou__
yes mostlikely it 's the intel device . the Nvidia device is probably for sound over hdmi __eou__
What do you mean ? __eou__
no , live cd 's require at least 1gig of ram ... you can try the alternet install cd , but w/ that low amount of ram , ubuntu is gonna run like crap __eou__
on the server use netstat -tan and see if it 's listening on port 22 __eou__ if you are planning on port forwarding port 22 from the outside world for ssh . I would install the fail2ban suite to get rid of people trying to brute force your server . __eou__

Monkeydust never mind , thats ctrl alt f2 . It didn't work though , the bars didn't reappear . I've had my computer go CLI , and I'm too dumb to switch back to GUI so I had to restart . __eou__
I guess you should try # kernel.org or #kernelnewbies __eou__
how ? __eou__
it seemed if I remember correctly that things like Epiphany was not compiled with the sys try icon , and that there were just peices missing from the ubuntu-desktop package , I cannot remember much more .

I am not a fam of the whole shell game , it is a shame in my opinion that linux as a whole , in terms of desktop **unknown** __eou__ ns are all going the way of the shell __eou__
not the case .. it was re-added in after i did an update __eou__
that shud do it __eou__

both are USB . Yes I have unplugged them , used different **unknown** , put them in different ports __eou__ yes it works at grub screen .

huh ? I already reconfigured it to **unknown** It says " Starting GNOME display manager [ fail ] " when i boot __eou__
would metacity be affected that much by account permissions ? It should be standard for every account . I'm guessing I just FUBAR'd the settings a while ago __eou__

okay , thanks . __eou__ And it 's **unknown** , by the way . X3 __eou__
Are you talking about my question ? __eou__ Or yours ? __eou__
grub-install will take its information from /etc and put it in /boot I think , but what I want is to use the configuratino information in /mnt/root/etc and /mnt/boot __eou__

hell yeah . __eou__ forget startx lol xinit __eou__ how should I launch X . Tried this in rc . local but errors , running manually OK : su sam -c **unknown** __eou__

what is that ? __eou__

not to sure what you mean , fairly new to Ubuntu __eou__
/etc/default/locale is a simple ASCII text file . You could use a simple text editor and add another locale value in a row , comma-separated . But I do not recommend that . You probably do not know the function of this file . __eou__
you should read error messages , it says ' are you root ?' __eou__
No , sorry :( __eou__ What is the output of " groups "? __eou__ ! anyone | kieppie __eou__
in the meantime ? __eou__

I've tried it with the new Gnome shell , and although it 's actually better , is simply not good enough . This is supposed to be an LTS , and upgrading to the next minor release as a way to fix what broken now is a terrible cop-out , I'm sorry to say __eou__
I have resized and moved some partitions on my hdd and now I cannot boot(i don't get grub) , i have " fixed it " with boot-repair to place grub somewhere else on harddrive and now I am able to boot only windows ( I have dual boot win 7 and ubuntu ) but after few trials I have successfully installed grub on usb stick and i can boot to ubuntu with my usB :) ( kinda stupid ;) ) and now since I am ubuntu I have tried to reinstall grub to my /dev/sda with grub-ins __eou__
according to windows , i'm currently using 5.5 gb of ram running pidgin and windows update __eou__
yes , I am . I am currently using it to chat here . If you want I can paste here my fdisk -l dump so that you can see my other partitions as well cuz there might be issue with them . __eou__
so apt-get install it __eou__
but in Details it says 3.8 __eou__ terminal and doesn't reconcile with Details __eou__ how do I know which one is correct ? __eou__
??? xfce , lxde are also options you know . __eou__ xfce was adopted as the platform when ubuntustudio needed to transition from gnome . I am quite pleased with it . __eou__

http://pastebin.com/65etEnm0 __eou__ I've been tooling around Debian-based distros since Woody .

The repo was only active and used for three packages , and to even use them I had to force-version . __eou__ What I see is that the newer versions of packages are available , but not listed or expected . Where do you think the disconnect might be ? __eou__
because you deliberately broke it by adding an unsupported repo __eou__

I don't know ... this network I've always had to manually set speeds . I set my win7 box to gigabit full manually , and it STAYS that way . On ubuntu I have to set it manually because it won't come up at the right speed . __eou__
no __eou__
hhmmm it 's possible __eou__ although it has started to happen even when I'm not running any graphics-intensive programs __eou__
you could reduce the sysctl vm . swappiness . it should be 60 as standard . __eou__ +/- buffers __eou__
thanks . also whenever kernel upgrades to newer version , i cant boot to full graphical system . i have to install nvidia drivers again and then it boots normally . __eou__
sure it can . __eou__ if Vbox does not have your windows in preset , it won't. __eou__
you'll have to look for it __eou__
how do you mean ? __eou__
Oh , okay . __eou__
yes __eou__ another hints is that i created a new test user ... if i switch ( and switch doesn't work well ) to it ... i have only that desktop icons doesn't show __eou__
hey i'm getting this only when i connect my usb modem . __eou__ so does it mean that there is a problem with my usb modem ? __eou__
do you have web access ? __eou__
then delete the end slash , the script will then run __eou__ if the script runs forever , rather than firing once , add an ampersand to the end of the line , like so : /home/testuser/scripts/batch03 & __eou__

What is your first language ? __eou__
they show as " active sync " __eou__ it 's a newly created array , synced overnight __eou__ the only odd thing is the device is /dev/md127 when i'm sure i specified /dev/md0 __eou__ during the create call , that is . so i don't what **unknown** is going on with that __eou__
Yea I used to bridge a connection to my xbox without crossover cable __eou__
um im not entirely **unknown** 's why i could use some help . I tried dualbooting ubuntu , but after installing 12.04 the Windows 7 loader didn't appear in grub __eou__
use the web and see what the error means when you used the modprobe command __eou__ I recommend you install Precise , it may help things __eou__
yes __eou__
reboot to test __eou__
Then the answer is " Somewhat yes ." __eou__
i64 __eou__
That 's because A : Grub doesn't yet automatically detect UEFI based Windows installs and B : You booted Ubuntu 's installer via the BIOS interface , and thus it installed grub-pc rather than grub-efi . __eou__
Sure it will " work fine " I just thought someone had gotten CULV into the kernel core fixed so it reduced power consumption and battery __eou__
that is my only option __eou__

If you're just getting a blinking cursor then the problem is deeper than your grub . cfg , grub itself isn't being loaded properly . __eou__
I'm going to try what you have posted let 's see __eou__
ah , damn __eou__
You bet I did . __eou__
thanks , I'll try that :) __eou__

I would try to get a default copy of the settings from a fresh user account and overwrite your file rather than delete it , only because I don't know that it regenerates itself automatically and it 's a file that you need to have for a lot of things to be functional . __eou__
I installed one from the official adobe website via USC , then i installed via terminal sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer . __eou__ Flashplugin-installer __eou__ Is there any other way , i am thinking about trying with Synaptic .

You're welcome . __eou__

Both still can be done . __eou__

Thank you . __eou__ Would you happen to have any experience with HPT raid controllers under Ubuntu ? __eou__
well , you can try more targeted searching than just doing `du` on every folder ; like , look in /var , look in /home ( esp for hidden dotfiles / folders ) __eou__

I didn't upgrade my kernel myself , unless it was in one of the automatic updates Ubuntu does , but before the error , when I booted it would say something about monitor configuration being wrong , and my left monitor was configured to be on the right , I'd have to fix it every time I rebooted . Can't think of anything I did since then that should have broken anything __eou__
working on that now __eou__
Blue1 , I'm guessing that 's a BIOS thing , not a Ubuntu thing __eou__
yes someone else was asking about exchange on linux i was just saying i wasn't aware of a way to do it __eou__
im not sure ive never done it __eou__ why not use google sync ? __eou__ or is this for work ? __eou__

BIOS ... OK , anything in particular I should look for there ? __eou__
I can't paste because it 's a different machine from this one . __eou__
Thanks . I'm not used to this **unknown** thing , though . How do I find it ? __eou__
can't help , never used recordmydestop __eou__ or try kazam __eou__
you should be able to do it for the whole screen to , I checked some forms and in some cases it needed a patch to work on some graphic card ... I don't know in your case how you can fix this but it is caused by your graphic card __eou__ forums* __eou__
thanks ... __eou__
Well without the exact error it 's hard to tell :) Some apps may look if you're running $Environment and refuse to run on bare X , etc __eou__
i do believe there are options in scripts to provide answers to those . man apt-get __eou__
OK , I click OK on the error alert . __eou__ This is what it says next : Bootloader install failed . Sorry , an error occurred and it was not possible to install the bootloader at the specified location . How would you like to procees ?

theadmin giving ubottu the ! ics command helped more than you asking me to google __eou__ I had googled , but got nowhere . " Internet Connection Sharing " is a term I had not looked up . __eou__

what is your question ( on one line please) ? __eou__ pastebin your command and full output __eou__
**unknown** the system is currently doing some other tests , so I cannot test the output .. I'll reboot the board and then check __eou__
FTP all by itself is pretty insecure , freaks out on firewall/NAT , and you can generally get what you need done via SFTP , which is really just SSH __eou__ if ssh is enabled , SFTP is too __eou__ meaning you don't have to do any more work __eou__
so just keep trying the steps ? __eou__
ActionParsnip : Any idea why when running /etc/init . **unknown** restart I would lose the connection again ? that seems to the be what disables my connection whenever I reboot . Typing ifup eth1 makes it work again . __eou__
this is the biggist space between to radio I've ever seen :P , how to make the md5 test ?? __eou__
update will only check for new things , not install them __eou__
np __eou__
logging in as root would use the settings of root , believe me , you don't want everything running with root settings __eou__ using sudo uses your user 's settings with root 's permissions __eou__
so its not a size issue . are there any other drives installed that grub might have written to ? __eou__
thanks ! Shall I connect the NFS servers to ISCSI storage direcly or store it " internally " ? __eou__

it 's the same on all OSes . when you suspend , power to the physical RAM is cut . the contents have to go somewhere or they get lost . it gets paged out to disk . __eou__ do you *need* suspend ? is hibernate enough ? __eou__ again ... suspend requires a minimum swap of > 1.1 *RAM . __eou__ one-point-one multiplied by the amount of physical RAM __eou__ yes . and even then it may not work at all , depending on Sony 's implementation . __eou__ it may require fiddling with pm-utils . it may only hibernate and not suspend . __eou__ it worked in Linux with no swap ? __eou__ i have never heard of a true Linux install ( not zombified Wubi stuff ) not needing swap to suspend . __eou__ might . __eou__ weren't you asking about this last week ? __eou__ are you now a pm-utils expert ? __eou__ as suggested last week , you need to install the pm-utils package and begin to learn its machinations . __eou__
can't script it ... __eou__
thanks __eou__
the latest on 10.04 repos are the 7.7 . 1 that now i'm using __eou__ i would upgrade it , it 's a little bit old __eou__
I dont know - keep asking , or try asking in #linux __eou__ do you think you need to install lvm2 ? __eou__
but I would like to write virtualhost name and get to a specified url on the host , like that I would need to specifiy the path .. __eou__
there 's a whole lot of stuff in syslog ... __eou__

i usually start from default ubuntu 's kernel ... which is fine , and just fill in the differences of the patch i am applying . __eou__
yeah , I intend to do that once I fix my install __eou__ if I use the same username as the old install , will it preserve the files , DJones ? __eou__ I can't - not enough free space on my drive to do so __eou__
I would see a manpage of a specifi program in a specific folder via terminal __eou__ For example I downloaded a manpage file , and I would see it via terminal __eou__

theres no important data on that machine . will ubuntu work when its installed on another machine ? __eou__
You can ' ps axuw | grep tty'. It shoud come up with some lines . __eou__ No , not needed .

Alright , thanks ! __eou__ What torrent client are you using , **unknown** ? __eou__ I see XD __eou__

no clue - i'm not a programmer at all ... __eou__

tell us from start __eou__

thanks . I am aware of that . __eou__

you can use fdisk to scan drive 's and partitions like " sudo fdisk -l " __eou__ this will give you a list of drives and partitions that are attached and then you can mount these drive 's to the place that you would like to mount it to example " sudo mount /dev/sda$ /mnt " where $ is the number of the drive like " sudo mount /dev/sda1 mnt " mount < DRIVE Number > < Where you want to Mount > __eou__

Samba has two major things about it . 1 > It provides CIFS shares that other OS 's can access , 2 > For Samba to Samba , it provides POSIX extentions over it , so Linux to Linux , it will maintain a level of your standard Linux permissions . __eou__

it loaded the page but there were no videos or errors either __eou__
Very much so . While Flash is ' free ' in the sense it doesn't cost you anything to have a Flashplayer it is not free as in ' Open Source'. HTML5 is to become a standard that is supposed to support other media ( movies and such) . __eou__
np __eou__
As far as I know there was no trigger . I don't mess around with sudo . __eou__
to speed up the system .. I imagine that all that data collecting is slowing it down . __eou__ I kinda have a performance issue right now . __eou__

Probabilly it is great for an enterprise __eou__ no , all pc 's are in different places and each one haw own wan ip __eou__ anyway , assuming that I use the script , how to cnon it has root via bash script ? I'm finding trouble because it seems that ' crontab ' accepts command only written directly by ' crontab -e'. Do you know some way to fix this problem ? __eou__

why is that so ? __eou__
It 's not supported by parallels . __eou__
i know that ... i didn't realize 12.04 had hit 12.04 . 1 yet __eou__
hmm , one would think ... that is strange __eou__
its still 12.04 LTS in details shouldnt it be 12.04 . 1 or something ? __eou__
you need help , i'll be here a while .. i've gotten pretty good at samba __eou__ you don't really need to reboot , you just need to restart samba __eou__

I still have no idea what swat is :) __eou__ tried this one ? http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/SWAT.html __eou__ well ... what works or doesn't work ? __eou__ probably they're sleeping ... ask , and wait :) __eou__

for sure dude , maybe im just a slow learner eh ? :p __eou__ it gives you a gui for server configs __eou__
gives me unrecognized service . __eou__

I'm reading up on that right now , actually . Sounds hellishly complicated , but probably exactly what I'm looking for . __eou__

ah - ok __eou__
thank you for the reply will 64-bit operating system will not run in virtual box ? __eou__
maybe 12.10 , but not 12.04 __eou__ use blueman -- adapter - preferences - friendly name __eou__ use sudo apt-get apt-remove to delete obsololete soft -- also delete old kernels __eou__ that 's sudo apt-get autoremove __eou__
then it sounds like formatting loss __eou__ it is not , 56GB of 4000GB __eou__

I agree wilee-nilee ... I just myself don't know how to do it ;) __eou__ thank you for your help ... i'll keep playing with it __eou__
It could be a controller problem its hard to tell since slowdowns can be caused by so many things . __eou__
Let me show you the logic : rc . local is ran by init . init runs as root . Therefore , rc . local is ran as root . __eou__
Of course . High demand now . __eou__

could have sworn I checked there . Thanks . Feel like like an idiot now . __eou__
I expected that . I was just curious about physically syncing the data . __eou__
ooops - misunterstood __eou__
well , I'm not sure . I wasn't sure if rsync was specifically utilized by any sort of underlaying EXT properties . __eou__
i think you should verify with absolute certainty that your hardware matches the new ram stick __eou__ e.g. : make sure you're not overdoing with ram , i mean , make sure you don't have more ram than what you can support on your motherboard __eou__ and make sure about DDR2 / DDR3 matches __eou__ and now i see that your ram sticks work , if not together __eou__ you should check the bios settings looking for the dual channel option __eou__ of course . __eou__
i tried that but then it just keeps looping with the message that i need to update air and ask me i want to get the latest version __eou__

i dont know if its related , either , honestly __eou__
dahs does backticks though ? Or no ? __eou__ when I write scripts I always write ... /bash , and everyone else can just bugger off : > __eou__

linking you to the error __eou__ took a photo __eou__ http://i.imgur.com/zO7ba.jpg __eou__ does this and then ejects the CD . then my windows 7 starts up normally . __eou__ http://i.imgur.com/zO7ba.jpg __eou__ sorry , i meant to type that its ubuntu 12.04 . 1 __eou__ king_cobra suggested i try to install an older version ? __eou__
Ah ok , is there any way to have it always pop up without the shift key ? Or is this a necessity ? __eou__ & **unknown** : Thanks , that worked :) __eou__
thanks __eou__
i recall some ' ignore case ' in my " mastering regular expressions ' but it May depend on the exact regexp options sed 's regexp engine takes . __eou__
i think its ~/ . fonts __eou__ one sec , checking __eou__ you will find them there and in /usr/share/fonts __eou__ if you are not sure how to do it , follow this guide https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts __eou__
WELL , THATS NOT WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING __eou__
: I ran mem 86+ overnight no errors __eou__
it was the default option when installing ubuntu , it loads everything as kvm-qemu and i have libvirt , not exactly sure which it is using __eou__
I don't /want/ to install it , though ! __eou__
you have any ideas ? __eou__
I know , and I use it all the time . __eou__
I'm not very knowledgeable about the differences between the two , but I do know that UEFI is slated to completely supersede BIOS __eou__ UEFI support GPT ( GUID Partition **unknown** , which allow for up to 128 partitions , as well of maximum hard drive sizes above 2TB . __eou__
I looked at that link you posted ... I'm pretty sure you removed some extra stuff inadvertently . maybe even the PAM auth modules . __eou__ what dmp said . If you made /home a seperate partition , just reinstall using xubuntu or kubuntu and go from there . __eou__ http://bit.ly/OgxtBL __eou__ sorry ... I was being facetious . I won't ever do that again . __eou__ what tenX said . __eou__
or you could use a live cd then chroot into your system , re-add yourself as a user __eou__ also *probably* not a good idea to echo your password on here __eou__ you could just re-install :P __eou__
any ideas about my partition Q ? __eou__
that would be a problem . lol . __eou__
this is not the jokes channel . take it elsewhere __eou__
*shrug* I wasn't using it a year ago . __eou__
Ok ... i made only 1 primary partion and 1 swap primary partiion ( 20 GB ) of my whole 1TB DISK __eou__
not that I know of __eou__ but I am just finishing my 12.04 install for the first time now ;) __eou__
it 's empty __eou__
i thought you meant server __eou__
ok __eou__ ty __eou__
i do that in my 30G partition ;) __eou__ though it is getting full , heh __eou__
if you already have openssh-server installed , no file __eou__
**unknown** : if your provider have newsgroups , try NNTPgrab for ubuntu __eou__
no idea then . __eou__ nope __eou__
read the vnc over ssh thats a safer solution __eou__
no , basically I'm making a backup partition in case I need it . __eou__
Is that the Android app ? __eou__
try http://askubuntu.com/ __eou__
can you reboot your machine in to recovery . That is do you have physical access to the machine in question ? __eou__ Do you remember your password for your encryption ? __eou__
its pretty configurable . i think its a good thing . you pretty much dont have to think about it . just install it and it works __eou__
After login is too late . If there 's something that will decrypt my home directory automatically , it needs to be run /before/ I try to log in . __eou__
heres a easy manual about the setup on Win http://synergy-foss.org/help/user-guide.pdf __eou__

Just figuring out what the command is to check the output ... unless you can give it to me ? __eou__
i know .. i use that for me two finger never worked . maybe there is a pro around who knows(technically it works as you said ) __eou__
what text is on the screen , its not technical in any way __eou__ try uninstalling the nvidia drivers , reboot to the newer kernel then reinstall the nvidia drivers __eou__ sudo apt-get -- purge remove nvidia-current nvidia-current-updates nvidia-173-updates nvidia-settings-updates nvidia-settings __eou__ it 's one command __eou__ you can uninstall in any , but reinstall it in the newer kernel __eou__
Since newer kernel won't start visual interface __eou__

Ok thanks , I will definitely give it a try . Thanks again for your help __eou__
lol __eou__ i just use it to vnc my desktop from work neverhad any issues a nd i turn it off at work ' __eou__ at home __eou__
unless your running on the battery i would see no reasion to use the intel __eou__ have you looked in your monoter settings with a dual gpu you should be able to switch __eou__ i heard of this issue before and i think it took a bunch of configs and scripts to get ubuntu to swotch __eou__ lol go to catlayest controle center actvate second card __eou__ http://askubuntu.com/questions/66229/how-to-get-unity-working-on-dual-gpu-laptop __eou__ thers your fix __eou__
true . But with NVIDIA you can **unknown** them down to use far less power __eou__
I should explain what I have done . First I installed ubuntu 12.04 desktop edition and selected the option to install it alongside windows ( **unknown** . Then I installed ubuntu studio 12.04 so the system triple boots . The grub config in ubuntu studio works fine - it has all 3 OSs in its menu . __eou__
yes , but please don't paste multiple lines here ;) __eou__ try to find out , what may block the boot progress , e.g. try " mount -a " from the shell you get . maybe it tells you , that something else is not ready , and therefore it does not finish mounting everything " rw ". for X i suggest to move away xorg configuration files , that are not provided by the packages ... __eou__
anyone has a suggestion on a openvpn guide that works with ubuntu ? __eou__
you may be right , I don't want to downgrade or use a non lts version __eou__
Please have a look at this and help me out : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1166107/ __eou__
how do you mean ? __eou__
so then the guide is broken ? __eou__
but the weirdest thing is that if I add it in the software sources manager , it works . But then , if I try to apt-get install wine 1.5 it says the package doesn't exists __eou__
yep __eou__
have you tried booting to liveCD and fsck the partition , make sure it 's ok __eou__
if he has some point to discuss its offtopic . but to decide that its the ops job . __eou__

Yes . ext4 is the new ext3 . Either will work but there 's no reason to use ext3 these days over ext4 . But depending on what you want to do with it another filesystem may be better , which is why I asked . __eou__

it works on my other pc without , but i did install the latest hplib on the notebook , but didnt work __eou__
meh , just install it and remove it __eou__ I don't think there 's any nice short way . You're either going to have to parse the depends yourself or write something short to do it for you . Maybe you can rig something up with aptitude 's special search flags __eou__
I'll have a look , thanks __eou__
not familiar with that __eou__ you can install pastebin , then run a command like " ls | pastebinit " and it will give you a link __eou__

purge command deletes all old files , and autoremove deletes the whole program __eou__ what is the problem ? __eou__ go to the software center to install the browser __eou__ did you get it installed ok ? __eou__
Is this chrome or chromium ? __eou__

sorry , i've never used scalpel before , so i have no idea . best of luck . __eou__
from ubuntu ? don't think that 's possible . otherwise on os x : diskutil disableJournal /Volumes/TheVolumeName __eou__
thus you already removed it , but there are still config files ... you could re-add it/them , then purge if you wished ... __eou__
you just put up with it ? __eou__
even with just emmm peeee **unknown** ? __eou__
you can't use scp ? __eou__
my chances of recovering it are nil ? __eou__

no , what 's that ? __eou__
I understand what your saying ... but I'm thinking either this script is written terribly . Or I'm just a super scrub at unix-based OS . __eou__
send that to my backup drive ? __eou__
thats a filesystem limitation or .. out of disk space __eou__
yeah , it 's not giving me too much to go on there . __eou__

bekks ... well that should be the problem __eou__
And whats the actual problem then ? What exactly happens and what do you expect ? __eou__
ok . lemme try __eou__
Yes . __eou__ Any ideas ? __eou__
No problem . Glad to help . :D __eou__

a guide how to reproduce the bug is always best then they can figure out why it 's crashing or acting strangely __eou__ yassic __eou__ no he remove that partition he 's removing it from auto mount __eou__

if you're only going to run Ubuntu , just get a normal PC rather than a mac __eou__ that said , I'm running it on a macbook , because I got one relatively cheaply __eou__
yeah..that 's true . I'm not sure yet . May buy a custom desktop __eou__
no I don't do raid . but I have normal fat32-partitions that ubuntu sometimes like to check during start , I don't want that . I want to check them manually when I have time __eou__

there is only a backup if you make one __eou__ why did you not make a backup if the data is important to you ? __eou__ you can maybe use foremost __eou__ you have learned the value of backups the hardest way possible __eou__

please be so kind and give us some more information . Like how many paritions do you have on this disk , on which partition is /boot , /home etc ... __eou__
plz help me __eou__
yes I heard there was some disadvantages to it . But I am worried messing with the windows boot system ? __eou__
over my head . that said , if it'll run in ubuntu , then run the test and find out if you get better results . __eou__ best of luck __eou__ wubi is an ubuntu TESTING environment . it is NOT a permanent installation solution . So sayeth the wubi developers . If you're not sure you want a full fledged ubuntu install , consider virtualbox . Otherwise , dual boot . __eou__ even if ubuntu overwrites the windows bootloader , you can repair it with the windows install disk . ( you'll lose the ubuntu boot , of course ... ) __eou__ sounds like a dpkg lock __eou__
I am on 64 bit system and I only run 64 bit binary __eou__
precise __eou__
it was secret ! __eou__
I'm not . __eou__ the bug was found on the beta2 and hasn't been fixed . __eou__ yes , that is the one I'm using . __eou__
the link to the package says 404 Not Found . __eou__ Ok found the package . Will install it now . __eou__ Thanks for your great help sir . It worked . Thanks again . __eou__
silly to ask , but you DID hashcheck the iso ? __eou__
thanks :D __eou__
then you listened to a bad tutorial __eou__ visudo is something you run as your user ( not root ) __eou__
but if I am not mistaken in there were a option on the System Settings menu to ajust the launcher size at Ubuntu 12.04 , no ? __eou__
you might know the answer to my question , please see above , thanks __eou__
I'll re-make and give it a shot . I'll try anything at this point . __eou__
I can connect to it internally __eou__
why do you need file extensions __eou__
no . Using the latest as of last night . __eou__
I just entered the password at the time of login . __eou__
thanks , will take a look __eou__
sudo -k shows nothing in root session . I think I'll have to switch to **unknown** . __eou__
make a copy of grub . cfg and verify . Those entries should be coming from /etc/grub . **unknown** which I know get called when you run update-grub __eou__ if the issue persists , then I guess you have to troubleshoot those scrits in /etc/grub . **unknown** __eou__ but , yes I just read the update-grub script and it 's likely not to make a difference . So check the scripts in /etc/grub . **unknown** . There 's one there that checks for other linux installs __eou__
I would prefer not to edit the files in question manually , is there a way around ? __eou__
thanks , but that is only for convert from idx/sub to srt . I need the other way : from srt to idx/sub __eou__
! patience | Guest22244 __eou__
in 12.04 ? __eou__
of course I could manually paste them in . But that surely isn't the proper way . ( 1 ) it would get washed away every time an ubuntu update required updating grub . cfg ( eg . a kernel update) , ( 2 ) it would require me struggling every time Fedora updated its own grub configuration ( eg . each time a new kernel is installed) . __eou__
, sir that looks fine .. is there any other way to upgrade __eou__
well you continue __eou__
External clients couldnt connect to my VSFTPD server . So I set **unknown** , and now it works .

install the extras package __eou__
what do you mean ? I had to copy a version from my arch box 's /etc/skel to get it on here initially ? __eou__
same thing ;) __eou__
hmmm __eou__
well , I can't even get to console , since the keyboard isn't working . __eou__
sorry , man . getting the broadcom chipset on wifi is the limit of my experience . __eou__
the program is still listed in some menu ? __eou__
( with an sshd option) , but jailrooting a shell access you have to do manual work __eou__
it does auto mount at boot as /home the tutorial had me edit the fstab so it mounts at boot as /home and move home to **unknown** ... could it still be mounting at boot and making it so i can't login ? __eou__
F4 for open terminal , I use CTRL-T for tabs rather than split screen , or more often I open two instances of pcmanfm if I really want that __eou__

earlier , you meant **unknown** c.d , correct ? __eou__

i could't put that better :) __eou__
can u send me the link __eou__
let me try ... __eou__
it 's not so important , but thanx . __eou__
thanks __eou__
until every BIOS boots from USB natively , it 's still cool . __eou__
okay , that 's helpful ; try ' grep video /etc/group', user_ __eou__ I will read that documentation , thanks cristian __eou__
odd . well good thing you solved it __eou__
ok , thanks :-) __eou__ it seems the codec is H264 MPEG-4 AVC1 ( whatever that means :-) ) __eou__ installing ubuntu-restricted-extras leads to occasional updates of the screen ( every 10 seconds or so ) whereas it was completely black beforehand ... I guess this is an improvement :-) __eou__
what about you provide us more info about your problem you have on 10.04 ? card brand ? wpa security ? __eou__
they are not a set in a sense that they belong together , but of the files I own , only one produce this behaviour . __eou__ but why does it play fine with vlc on my notebook ? __eou__ I even tried vlc under ubuntu on the mediacenter box - crash . but mplayer works ... *confused* __eou__ thinking that copying the file over might have corrupted it , i compared md5sums - identical __eou__
yes __eou__
you'd need to run it in a terminal __eou__
it 's unaccessable from some places . __eou__
thanks , I'll try that __eou__
try settings>details __eou__
put it in a pastebin and make a ubuntu forum post , link to the pastebin from there __eou__
don't sugest them __eou__
the upgrade shows no package for installation , only a few packages held back , much less of course than what the update manager shows __eou__
vnc4server has been good for me as well , but just gives me grey screen with terminal on 12.04 __eou__
any other suggestio , I am testing some software in development and need to set a date in future __eou__
after reboot or shutdown , there 's an ubuntu loading screen , if pressing F1 you see txt info on the shutdown .. maybe thats revealing something ? __eou__
the terminal says it depends on libnspr4-0d but it ' s not going to install __eou__
understood . welcome . __eou__
I tried removing the rules file and reboot but the problem is still there __eou__ : I tried patching the negative zero channel problem on aircrack suit a couple days ago , can it be a problem by any chance ? __eou__
not something I can add any meaningful advice to . Sorry . __eou__
thanks : > __eou__
ok . what could be a useful explanation for firefox being able to resolve via dnsmasq , shell tools cant ? __eou__
if it 's just syntax highlighting then gedit will do fine __eou__
alright that 's what I'll do , do I lose out on anything else by using the minimal vs . the regular image ? __eou__ like will there be less packages other than the desktop not installed ? __eou__
thanks again __eou__
just as a matter of interest , which languages are you looking for highlighting for ? __eou__
: after that upgrade the kernel and let us know if it detects the RAM fine . PAE should work out for upto 64GB ram __eou__
maybe just use a different music player ? :P __eou__
it only shows kubuntu desktop and kubuntu full on minimal cd __eou__
so it 's a load balancer issue or something ? __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Finland __eou__
you sure you using the full had partitioning ? check for sure with gparted __eou__ ! info gparted | ubuntu_noob __eou__ http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ __eou__
nope , bahnhof __eou__ but it might be going through some telia lines on the way .. sweden is telia-land after all =) __eou__
that 's a weird group . well you can use ' sudo ' to perform commands as root . __eou__
well itll load when he logs in __eou__ i guess ure right __eou__
thank you !!! __eou__
do we know when is going to be ready ? __eou__ thank you very much for your help __eou__
its running 10/100 eth1 and 10/100/1000 eth0 ... hmm gona check something __eou__
ah - I am using KDE , so maybe that is my problem , thanks __eou__
only reason i'm testing it is for the multiseat functionality __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ yes , i can se partition with gparted __eou__
correct . you will have that version of Firefox , with some point releases to address backported fixes . __eou__ this is assuming you use only the default repositories . __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1169982/ __eou__ it 's a drive with just files on it __eou__ nope , the other two partitions are my windows partition for windows install __eou__ haven't even heard of it __eou__ would you happen to know whether I need to do anything now to remove the mbr on the drive with the files or anything I need to do ? __eou__
just a little strage .. it seems like evolution is loading the flags i set in thunderbird , but it is storing changes locally somehow __eou__
thanks __eou__
no , doesn't show up in fdisk -l , nor anywhere else __eou__
nothing seemed to have happened apart from **unknown** , **unknown** installed __eou__
what do you mean ? reinstall ? __eou__ will all my data be lost if i do that ? __eou__
any bios upgrades you can try for suspend problems on sony driver site ? __eou__
free -m in terminal __eou__ how sure are you the other ram worked in windows __eou__
- thank you :) __eou__
i knew the internal ip part , but not the version light __eou__
I am aware __eou__
that sounds like what i need to do for now ... i need to learn more base things ... ty __eou__
it 's very easy to turn into styled HTML , or TeX or whatever __eou__
its on the server and i dont know how __eou__
ok .. thank you __eou__
i am sorry please . just curious . Nautilus ( windows manager ) mounted it as " blank DVD ". when I mouseover , it shows blank :/ // . is there a way to access this " mount point "? __eou__
i did . Even a SP/2 works in the same way . I did a new kernle , but it didnt help either . __eou__ http://paste.ubuntu.com/1170171 __eou__
Unfortunately no __eou__
I would like to try KDE __eou__ I willl plug in my USB Printer for now :) __eou__
yes , that 's where I got inspiration for the nick , XD __eou__
I've seen forums on this problem , but I do not understand them . __eou__
You can give the process -v for verbose . Also , see if your crontab has a $HOME setting and use that path and see if it works from command line . Also , ntpdate is normally in /usr/sbin/ntpdate , spec the full path if needed . __eou__ Also , Do you have /etc/cron . **unknown** chmod'ed executable ? __eou__
giving the root account a password , and allowing remote root login via ssh . __eou__
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config : PermitRootLogin no __eou__
Of course , if you change it manually it 's not that random anymore . ;-) __eou__
if you run it from there a few times , I think you'll see it in the dashboard . __eou__ since it becomes a " frequent " app __eou__ if you don't like Unity though , feel free to use another window manager __eou__
**unknown** ... thanks checking __eou__ :) __eou__
yup it 's at it 's max . __eou__
I could ask an **unknown** channel , but I guess it wouldn't be as active as this one , that 's why I'm asking here __eou__
the program is WhatPulse and doesn't have an icon , it starts in the " tray " __eou__ correction , it has an icon on the dock but I don't want it to lock there , I want it to " lock " in the applications thingy so I can click the Unity Ubuntu icon and simply type " WhatPulse " __eou__
https://launchpad.net/subversion __eou__ you can also do a search at http://packages.ubuntu.com/ __eou__
I was thinking of putting 8.04 LTS instead of 12.04 LTS on that machine with 512MB ... but I guess 8.04 LTS is no longer supported ? __eou__
lol thats funny . That IRC log was of me under my old nickname ha ha __eou__
there is also canonical-census package that pings ubuntu telling it i am alive on oem machines __eou__ mp __eou__ whoopsie handles bug and crash reporting i believe __eou__
after what ? __eou__
And I am constantly not insulting you . __eou__
do the sha256sum on your backup files first to get baseline . __eou__
if can't read the CD at all means it has no usable filetable , no ? __eou__
I'm not decided on a dm , yet , so yeah , just blackbox right now __eou__
how do I get the clean baseline for my Ubuntu version ? __eou__
gordonjcp I would use ddrescue without the drive mounted . __eou__ sorry gddrescue not to be confused with ddrescue __eou__ turn off auto mounting and then insert the cd to image it . __eou__ sorry chage the end of that false __eou__ then to re-enable send the same command with true __eou__
thank you . but will Ubuntu 12.04 LTS be ... slow on 512MB RAM ? __eou__
I think it 's the file which contains all the settings for vpn __eou__
from a su ' dpkg-reconfigure -a ' __eou__
ans Zeptis : there is some old SUN Solaris stuff on it __eou__
hmm . my issue is when i try using it in a for loop . how do i background something in a for loop ? __eou__
how come your text is in red ? __eou__
sure , I thought there might be another way since there are so many kernels that build up . __eou__
ok . __eou__ thx __eou__
np __eou__
Then try a single card . __eou__
do you have AllowOverride set to none anywhere , and have you checked the logs ? __eou__
then you want to find a GPL SSH program that has a Windows RPC feature __eou__
I dont know what you're talking about __eou__ listen if i was not a noob i would not be using deluge on ubuntu . __eou__ do you have an experience with *BSDs ? __eou__
**unknown** : i am not sure i have been sent a link but wanted to setup a cron job to do wget overnight but i am getting an error __eou__ the link is . wmv and the resulting file is . wmv __eou__ **unknown** : was that directed at me ? __eou__ **unknown** : no capture - its just a standard ahref link and hence i thought if I can do save link as in a browser successfully that wget would work fine but it doesnt __eou__
I am not clear on the USB Installer file options to download . I am after 12.04 32 bit ubunutu , which one do I pick ? ( 1 ) Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop , ( 2 ) Ubuntu 12.04 DVD , ( 3 ) Ubuntu 12.04 Alternate i386 ?? __eou__ ok thanks __eou__ is " ubuntu 12.04 desktop " a 32 bit version ? __eou__
look it up now http://bit.ly/RoN0QS __eou__
does ~/ . **unknown** __eou__
but in both cases does not work fine , I'm clueless __eou__ I would prefer use a mode that does not need switch support __eou__
i have looked around and cant really find anything __eou__ **unknown** get nothing from ##linux __eou__
nah ... KDE 3 I loved ... KDE 4 .... meh ... too much like Mac OSX , but without the functionality __eou__
Ok , I recommend 2.5 GB for swap , 40 GB for / , and 60 GB for /home . Save the rest for future expansion . __eou__ That will give you plenty of room for a long time . __eou__ It will not do anything with it . It will just be " free " on your disk . You can use it later , if you need to . __eou__ If you feel the necessity to use it all right now , use 4.5 GB for swap , 40 GB for / , and the rest for /home . __eou__
Yeah .. I just don't get why anything has plymouth for a dependency __eou__ and why the kernel has a dependency on plymouth , when no other distro has a dependency on plymouth __eou__
true , but upstart has already been around sometime now . __eou__
does ini **unknown** have documentation ? __eou__ thanks krababbel __eou__
i need to pool drives what about greyhole ? __eou__ i like zfs but have not used it before __eou__
ah ... so cause and effect ? __eou__
word __eou__
look I'm no expert on these things , xsensors is general and modular in it 's approach , it 's basically a kind of desktop widget . The tool you point to is much more specific and displays framerates , not **unknown** , as far as I can see __eou__
im aware of those but its a tail chase __eou__
really ? why doesn't debian require it ? __eou__
thanks lbl , so when I install say ... vim-gtk and tunnel it to my windows machine , its not actually using gtk just the X window system right ? __eou__
maybe they don't have fuse running in the installer . __eou__ I would use a posix compliant fs for home . Use ext4 __eou__ yeap __eou__ I usally create primary partitions for / and /home and put swap on an extended/logical partition __eou__ but it 's up to you doesn't really matter __eou__
celthunder : OK thanks , I thought so . I'm just following a tutorial and I don't know what to substitute for " gnome-session " in this script , because I don't know what KDE 's session manager is . __eou__
but there is an option to let Ubunut delete all the current paritions and use the whole HDD for ext4 __eou__
i think i have tried using nautilus before but for some reason it doesn't show up until i mount it __eou__
apt-cache policy nodejs npm ; in your instance I suppose __eou__
give me a sec __eou__
I c . Trying to be able to run unity in 3d , but that is not possible at the moment . I am getting GL_VENDOR = VMware , Inc . which should have said Intel ... __eou__
unless there is a bug in grub or something __eou__ yeah if you install grub to the mbr you should be able to have boot on extended __eou__ he want 's to share his entire root but doesn't understand the consequences __eou__
just double click on my name in your chat program __eou__
whoa , must be a really popular series than , DRM hurts the wrong people , it should be abolished . __eou__ than => then __eou__

muon is broken , and the package manager doesn't work . __eou__
can't find a ppa for it __eou__ i don't get it , according to **unknown** , it should be supported __eou__
yeah , this is my fave shoutcast radio channel . i love old country . __eou__
sorry man ... i came up with nothing . there are plenty of clients to control the fan speeds , etc ... but they are not part of the vanilla ubuntu server iso . Perhaps it 's built directly into the kernel ? there are a few control **unknown** , thinkfan , fancontrol , but these are addons for tweaking the fans . not what ubuntu usually uses ... __eou__ any joy ? __eou__
cool , h22turbo , samsung stratosphere here __eou__
don't know , no one ever asked me that before . 10 bit video stream ? __eou__ i couldn't find anything that said totem doesn't, but i did find that vlc absolutely does , according to a forum __eou__ here 's the straight poop : Dec 26 , 2011 ... Totem unfortunately doesn't support 10-bit encoded x264 videos yet . If you want to play those videos , you'll need to use a different video player ... __eou__ sorry your having such a hard time . From what i have read , i can't seem to find anything that lets you play encrypted blue ray discs ... maybe this is your problem ? __eou__ oops , my bad . __eou__ I like openbox for that reason . openbox with lxpanel flies like a **unknown** on greased tracks . __eou__
okay , thx __eou__
what are the symptoms of your problems ? :) __eou__
it 's still the same . But you should really read the information ubottu sent you __eou__
Thanks , that works . __eou__
nothing , Meris , I just posted that right before you did __eou__
what do i do exactly ? __eou__ ok __eou__
not vm . you reboot the machine with the linux kernel , and then run the blueray . it doesn't play encrypted blue ray though ... __eou__
Not protecting myself . Just not willing to help someone ELSE break their company policies they put in place , with a full infrastructure ( firewall) , and all . __eou__
thats not what i said , i said i don't think it can be done natively(the way you're wanting to do it) .. __eou__
um , did i say something strange or bad ? __eou__
you sure you dont mean 2 directories ? __eou__
o_O __eou__
ahh , but grasshopper , you do NOT need to reinstall linux . You only need to reinstall the bootloader . __eou__ installing windows then ubuntu just avoids restoring grub bootloader . __eou__
oh , lol __eou__
what is the grpahics card of your machine ? __eou__
too bad . I am enemy with windows and don't have any device you mentioned ... Well . I'll stick to the phone screen __eou__
gracias bro __eou__

so should i do what he says dpkg -l | awk ' **unknown** $2 } ' | sudo xargs dpkg -P __eou__
lol , only like 4 peeps in that channel __eou__
thanks for looking into it . I'm going to avoid the kernel updates from proposed __eou__
older than that . I've tried a couple of combinations of GeForce 210's, 9800's, 9600 's and 8400's. None of them work properly . Turning on Xinerama usually breaks , but TwinView works for just two of them __eou__
no shit ? sudo init 3 __eou__ mythbuntu still uses GDM , right ? __eou__ is there another user still logged in ? __eou__ you may have to do that . __eou__
which is why you backup your /home first . __eou__
by the way , if you go that way , assign a larger a / partition . 1 or 2 updates and that things going to max out . You ; ll need to clean out the . debs with sudo apt-get clean , but your user won't know that , will he ? __eou__
ok - that worked easily for me , so seems to make sense __eou__ GF210 here on 295.40 official with dual screen __eou__
they look like better options , as your isp may have policies against downloading things like hashcat __eou__
cracking win 7 password from ubuntu 12 __eou__

u dont need one for linux .... autorun stuff works on windows ... and malware that uses USB spread ( autorun ) only works on windows __eou__
ah , ok .. i have no idea on ATI ... i hate ati . __eou__ i highly doubt it , because it uses the nvidia configuration tool to set it up . __eou__
to stay a bit ontopic , you saying an ubuntu server is fully safe against specialized rootkits ? __eou__
I would try asking the bugzilla people to get a better answer than anyone here . __eou__
youtube as well __eou__
sorry wrong person __eou__
you can disable nouveau during boot ... and use something else so it will boot up properly __eou__

apt-get search **unknown** **unknown** returned me ' linux-libc-dev : **unknown** **unknown** ' Does it mean that I already have this header ( I think it 's path 's problems or something else) ? __eou__
is it disabled in bios ? or by a " hotkey " ? __eou__
how can I fix it ? __eou__
oh i haven't check BIOS yet . BUt there is no setting in the OS itself ? __eou__
you can boot a livecd or usb and mount your root paritition then chroot to that partition and edit the file and sudo update-grub . Or you can try passing command options at the grub menu . Hold the shift key down to get a grub menu __eou__ you should be able to press e at the grub menu to edit the current selected kernels boot options __eou__
errr , not sure yet , does log suppose to capture that ? __eou__
read up on it at webupd8 omgubuntu and askubuntu.com is all i did __eou__
dr_willis ok thanks guys , will do ! __eou__
I don't know where the installation directory of xampp/lampp is , i have to make changes in config . inc . php of phpmyadmin __eou__
you get the added benefit of the usb -> ability to run in persistent mode and your " live " stick stores changes as if it were an installed os __eou__
Good . Tell me what stage of installation are you in :) __eou__
it a refular install __eou__ regular* __eou__ no vm __eou__
xubuntu 12.04 , the package provides development files ( sources ) for libxslt __eou__
read up on how ssh keys and passwordless ssh works *properly* , and tread carefully __eou__ change their password __eou__
thanks for the idea , I am looking for soemthing more simple , I know theres a way __eou__
i like multitail coloring __eou__ ccze -A < file . log | less -R __eou__
using key based auth , its a local server __eou__
thank you ... It will protect the illegal data from the police , to be honest :D __eou__ " they'll just torture you for the passphrase/key " :) maybe , but I'll probably suffer from injury than sit in a prison for a half life , or just pay a fortune for that data :) __eou__
! medibuntu | cherfas __eou__ FYI " reinstalling " things in gnu/linux almost NEVER solves anything __eou__
IIRC those are not supported anymore by ATI in linux , I'd suggest staying with the OSS drivers , YMMV though . __eou__

hmmm I thought I tried that , but which way did you go about disabling and re-enabling the wireless ? __eou__
haha . No , we're doing inventory and while I TRIED VERY HARD to use a scanning gun ( for the actual counting ) and a smartphone ( to look at the list ) I've been outvoted and must print count sheets . __eou__
eventually I can get on . I see your fedora issue though ... I tried 16 for a bit and didn't have this problem at all . __eou__
guess i'll just kill that stupid NM __eou__
will that log me out or anything __eou__
because dreamweaver produces horrible unusable code __eou__
because the script does work when i run it manually __eou__
ok , thanks __eou__
sounds like a cool tool . i will try it(but for another purpose ) __eou__
I know but since the internet speed in this country is low i prefer to buy it __eou__
yes __eou__ i did that , i did lots of things and nothing __eou__

non critical being the kernel , GNU utils , shh , etc ? so I'll be getting updates for Firefox this that all the time huh , I just installed Ubuntu yesterday ? __eou__

upgrading means downloading and reinstalling everything from zero ? that mean about let 's say 500 MB of download ? or just 50 MB ? __eou__
no I just put the dvd in the ROM and then in greyish screen What language ? I hit enter on english and from then I jsut see a black screen __eou__

lemme see __eou__ now went on blinking blak page __eou__
http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/62/36519035.png/ __eou__
true , that might be a problem . You might install Windows on a larger parition , then install Ubuntu and install the gparted package and use it to reduce the Windows partition and create a brand new NTFS one __eou__
yep , it seems that firefox will be updated with every new release , odd why they chose to do that , most likely because of the frequent updates and wide-spread usage of the browser I'm guessing __eou__
ok __eou__
haha __eou__ Ok hang on __eou__ http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/62/36519035.png/ __eou__

Or anyone : installing that driver updates completely killed my gnome . After rebooting I'm presented with a ( tty ? ) .

You can call me ZDroid ( i am changing name because of freenode ) __eou__

thank you , I wasn't aware of that channel __eou__ it is a part of a research project , I don't have experience with ubuntu , would you perhaps know how to get menu items ( structure ) of all applications installed in ubuntu ? I tried **unknown** . **unknown** . **unknown** () but that returns nothing __eou__
-x is VERY different then -X for ssh __eou__
*I* don't need any support , but this channel is for supporting others , not random chat about what IRC client is best . __eou__
with gksudo terminal stays some seconds and command is returned with no run applicatiob ... __eou__
linuxmint is pretty much the same no ? __eou__
No more than any other media client . **unknown** , I don't want to start a flame war :P __eou__
use xchat , not xchat-gnoe __eou__
sorry , line wrap caused me to miss the last part of your sentence : | __eou__
maybe idk let me restart computer __eou__
As for restarting X from tty after making my xorg . conf ? I " ve tried " killall X " but still get error about X running when i try " starts " __eou__
if you have no other services running .. then theres nothing to really listen to the denyed ports . :) __eou__ so any other services you are running that need denied ? __eou__ details of your exact network setup would be handy .. im not sure how you are ' filtering ' ssh by having it open ,, and layoff the enterkey __eou__
but it does not let me use my own server as far as i know __eou__
installing __eou__ done .. now ? __eou__

but if it 's doing it in Windows and Ubuntu , it 's obviously not an Ubuntu problem __eou__
The onboard audio , the Creative sound card have seperate output jacks . The Wireless headset just a has a little USB thing . I'm guessing it has to be hardware related though because Ubuntu never really gives me problems , and now both it and Windows are acting up . One more fact I forgot to mention . The stuttering and static seem to be independent of the CPU load to some degree . Yes it happens when I'm playing Crysis , but it a __eou__

So who would be reporting I think you miss the point here . __eou__ name the exact problem . __eou__
apt-get update ? I have done that __eou__
Try booting from the USB drive you used to install Ubuntu . My guess is that " sda " was actually the USB drive , and that 's where grub was installed to . __eou__

you cant just log out of enlightment ? __eou__
any ideas ? __eou__
ok , I'd advise you to slow down and work this through __eou__ you're going to have quite tight restrictions and access control on a shared platform . __eou__ you need to talk to you hosting provider . __eou__ if you are not using your bandwifth limit , then what 's the problem ? __eou__ just ask them if they will allow you to install an IRC server and what the restrictions/limitatoins are __eou__ do you actually need an IRC server ? __eou__ most IRC network will allow you to create a channel __eou__
no __eou__

usually best bet is to make an ntfs partition you use in ubuntu . then you use that as kind of a ' shared ' partition __eou__ there are some mount flags to add as options in /etc/fstab to decrease unnecessary writes but as far as repartitioning or starting over no you wont break anything __eou__ there is no registry or HKCU or anything . everything is a config file and your config files are in /home . for instance do a find /home/$USER in terminal note all those files starting with a dot they're hidden config files __eou__ you have to use a livecd . gparted cannot work on partitions that are mounted so you cant run it on a partition your OS is using __eou__ good luck :) __eou__
be sure that you have saved your changes once you make them , that is a common mistake I see on some systems __eou__
there 's two radio buttons for unetbootin . one for " download the ISO for me " ( that 's the top one ) and " i already have the iso " ( the bottom one ) ... you put in your USB stick or CD BEFORE running unetbootin . select the device to write to , and continue __eou__ you cd drive is deceased and needs replaced __eou__ it 's in the repo i thought . anyway it 's also on sourceforge __eou__
I have did some research , but now it is down to implementation and there are a few details that are hard to find . __eou__
applications get installed to / all your settings and media files should get stored in /home __eou__ 15gb shouold be plenty __eou__
right but I am not running mint .. maybe I am missing something here . __eou__
what do you mean ? __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
are there any caveats to be aware of ? __eou__
thanks , i didn't know about the show flag in apt-cache . that is very useful . __eou__
I have top but that is it . __eou__ shows 0% on cpu an all __eou__
already figured it out :P __eou__ THANKS __eou__
So , for instance , I just grab one from the **unknown** , pop it into the " problem system ", and it attempts to recover the lost partitions . After that , I reinstall GRUB , and it ( ideally ) " automagically " finds them again ? __eou__
I don't think you can just get a hold off , pick your app and find the team probably . __eou__
that seemed to have done it . Thank you ! __eou__
I am using firefox __eou__
zykotick9 : thanks __eou__
thank you __eou__

I have reinstalled the alsa driver and reboot many times __eou__
do you have a discrete Headphone control in oyur mixer ? __eou__
would it be feasable to temporarily setup a dhpcd so that it recieves a ip .. do you run ssh vnc ect . so after you assighned it a ip you could connect and sort out which one it is ? __eou__
sudo apt-get install **unknown** __eou__
The GNOME desktop in comparison to what ? __eou__
hmm i guess i'll probably avoid it __eou__

Why doesn't the VirtualBox in the Ubuntu Software Repository work ? __eou__
Yeah , I've read of such things , but while banging apparently works for some , I'd rather go through everything else , BEFORE I risk completely wrecking it by bumping it too hard/in the wrong way __eou__
If you can figure out how to get the drive to show up at all , GNU ddrescue (*not* dd_rescue ) is a good tool for recovering all the data from it ( by creating a full disk image , if you have the room for that) . __eou__
How did you install autoproxy ? __eou__
That 4GB would be the LiveUSB stick . The HDD is something around 150GB __eou__
no they are the official ubuntu ones __eou__
look at what luftikuss typed cat /var/log/Xorg ---- | less __eou__ that will let you view the error __eou__
Ah , I have synaptic installed so I would just remove 15 and install 14.0 . 1 , and then lock it . __eou__
Acquire :: http :: Proxy " **unknown** "; __eou__ it seems correct __eou__
Yes . Corrupt partition . NTFS . __eou__
oh , I wouldn't know then pritesh __eou__ can't you log in to a unity session just to enable this , and then log back in to xfce ? __eou__
That 's normal . Create a partition table on the drive using GParted . __eou__ For future reference , " format " is a very ambiguous term which can refer to many different operations . __eou__
yeah . i suppose so many on here havnt heard of these issues cause tehy simply arnt having them . the brightness meter shows up but the actual light does not alter . __eou__
normally because it can't write to your home dir - possible permissions or disk full issues __eou__

I do primary for everything until I can't make anymore then I use logical . There are differences , but generally end users should just go primary unless the installer says they cant __eou__ a hard drive can have ( iirc ) 6 primary partitions __eou__

nobody attacked you __eou__
sudo restart ssh __eou__ did you save the changes to the configuration file ? __eou__ can you pastebin the config file and the output of netstat -tan __eou__ yes you need to edit sshd_config __eou__ idd you change it to 2277 ? __eou__ it kept it open cuz you're still connected on 22 __eou__ if you exit your session it should no longer be listening __eou__ disconnect from 22 then connect on 2277 and restart ssh __eou__ How do you have the network configured ? __eou__ can you ping the box prior to logging in ? __eou__
I can't tell from that what 's primary and what 's extended __eou__ you could extend the logical container to take up the free space and create more parttitions in there . I recomend using gparted of the live cd and getting out of windows thouhg . __eou__

provided by the vendor . Find me a BIOS and/or mobo vendor which doesn't provide bootable MinWin or DOS-based flashing tools . __eou__
what ? Official Ubuntu Support Channel ? __eou__
correct __eou__
I've done quite a bit researching about ACPI but I am not up-to-date about the new developments . I will do some nore snooping now . -- Thank you for commenting . __eou__

Yeah , Vostro 3750 __eou__
macbook 2 , 1 . ubuntu 12.04 x86 running in efi mode __eou__ cpu temperature is around 60C , but I dont think that its overheating . I always had this temps here . __eou__
about to try this , just want to confirm that you know I'm in Lucid __eou__ hopefully a non-issue . down the hatch ! __eou__ fixed ! thank you so much ! __eou__ didn't think it would work since command lightdm wasn't found , and that grep line DID show something ... and it all hung completely requiring manual restart when I did show-splash __eou__ but it is now all fixed __eou__
It works on a reboot from the install as well , when you install be plugged to the net and and tick the updates box in the install gui . __eou__
find /lib/modules/`uname -r` | grep snd | wc -l ==> 220 __eou__
actually , it 's offtopic , better go there -- what you can do : burn CD 's and distribute them for free __eou__

Well I can honestly say I haven't checked that . I will try and look . Thanks ! :) __eou__
from what i can see , i have the additional drivers installed , but jockey says there are no proprietary drivers being used and gives me no options to enable . __eou__
PERFECT ! You win ! __eou__
I know nothing about raid sorry __eou__
ok __eou__ what version ? __eou__
yah i read , sec checking my db for possible link to solution __eou__
Oh , i didn't know you get that far . Here 's a howto guide that may assist you further . http://askubuntu.com/questions/83577/how-to-repair-a-degraded-raid __eou__
do you use hybrid graphics ? __eou__
I did , it just adds the Activity bar and stuff , but not the like File Edit View etc in the applications ( like in windows ) __eou__ I got the CCSM __eou__
the site i want is flash based __eou__
you mean like fi and esac ? __eou__
rubbish , and in any case you couldn't even pay me to care about that __eou__
01:00 . 0 VGA compatible controller : nVidia Corporation GT215 [ Quadro FX **unknown** ] ( rev a2 ) __eou__ I was thinking of trying the text-based install , then somehow getting nvidia propriatery drivers from console on my first boot . I just don't know how to . I only saw the 3rdparty driver installer in graphic mode __eou__
thanks , any advice helps . __eou__
unfortunately it looks like i only have the version 15 debs in there __eou__
I'm using minicom to send textfiles over it . __eou__
well , you appear to have a mixture of Quantal and Precise sources in there __eou__ which isn't especially sane __eou__ furthermore looking at the errors it looks like it just can't find the PPAs for clamav , so you could try removing those lines __eou__
" running as administrator " - how ? __eou__
thanks ... __eou__
ah ! How do I unmute my mic and line-in so that they STAY unmuted ? __eou__ ^^ __eou__
already done this .... microphone still not working __eou__
I didn't ask to ask a question . I asked if there was a more appropriate place to ask apt-related questions . __eou__
I ran the command it is showing up :) __eou__
i am not sure what you mean by internet side __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
oh __eou__
my passphrase ! __eou__ thx ! __eou__
personally , i use pm-hibernate __eou__ ya , " more " shutdown ;) __eou__ oh sorry , hibernate has been disabled in **unknown** . my bad . __eou__
what would be the command to induce suspense ? __eou__ this post looks interesting http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11890267&postcount=57 __eou__
i can access my server from iphone __eou__ for example i gave u the url earlier and u were able to see my server __eou__ i dont understand when im try to access it locally it doesnt let me access it __eou__
Np . Love the unix community because everyone seems so willing to help . I'll try the " nomodeset " option and see how it goes . Thanks again ! __eou__ I'm about to attempt to recover a corrupt TFS media partition and probably make another to back it up to . Would you recommend formatting the new one as ext4 ? __eou__ hey . :D __eou__
lol __eou__
so when i type 192.168 . 0.254 __eou__ i can only access it when i type 192.168 . 0.254 __eou__
yeah , it 's out in the van and I can't be bothered moving ;-) __eou__
man rsync __eou__
if you mean seeing anything as random lines , then yes , I see that . __eou__
It actually does : " It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm , which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination ". __eou__
it just spit me out a UUID lol __eou__
it just spit me out a UUID lol __eou__
it supports sftp __eou__ rsync does if you pass it through ssh __eou__ with something like " rsync -ave ssh " __eou__
I do both design and dev __eou__
, yes . __eou__
no , it is generated and it can be rewritten __eou__ it 's a bit of Deep Magic though , so try not to do that ;-) __eou__
because it will become one of the greatest distros ever __eou__
oh nothing happened to me . We got to this conversation cause I was helping someone find a UUID of a disk and I had no idea you could actually change one :-) __eou__
so he will have to edit that file on every bootup for his dns to work ? __eou__ suicide ? __eou__ with no IP ? __eou__
ok here 's another question , how do i get netcfg to grab the hostname from dhcp ? __eou__
what do you mean by " the internet "? and login and pwd for what ? __eou__ so how do you know it 's 85 kB in size ? __eou__
sad panda __eou__
oh awesome . Doubt i'll ever need it __eou__ what would be the chances of the same UUID . if you had the same exact disk with the same partitions it would still give diffferent UUID right ?? __eou__
Yes . I know that . I'm just trying to allow more than one install to go at once . __eou__
same with removal __eou__ how do you mean ? __eou__ do you have software centre open ? __eou__ then let it finish , you can use multiple package names in apt-get , you don't have to install one by one __eou__
erin : i dont want to the entire disk __eou__ ok here 's another question , how do i get netcfg to grab the hostname from dhcp ? __eou__ i did that and that helped __eou__ but more importantly , netcfg wont get the hostname from dhcp __eou__
try in Unity2D session __eou__ depends on the chip __eou__
why are you needing to do this ? __eou__
i find it best to just use some sort of **unknown** . :) much faster then those usb cables __eou__
do you have synaptic or software center open ?? __eou__ there is ! __eou__
ok , i an trying an automated reinstall and i keep getting an error , i guess im not erasing enough __eou__
And oh yea , what does it mean by CD ? __eou__ I suppose like a 138mb floppy disc wont work ? __eou__ For installing Desktop LTS __eou__ Something like that __eou__
its on gnss-sdr README telling me to do it to probably enable rtlsdr(usb SDR device ) __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1178886/ __eou__
sure __eou__ /dev/sda1 * 2048 206847 102400 7 HPFS/NTFS/exFAT is all that shows after sudo fdisk -l __eou__
Ubuntu is cool in my head , so I'm not picky __eou__
yes , Unity isa shell for the gnome desktop __eou__ it replaces Gnome-panel as the default shell __eou__ so ... how do you mean ' wiped ' you never said __eou__ not seeing anything overly exciting there __eou__ what do you see when you log in ? __eou__
you should have a game called ' pioneers ' try running ' pioneers ' from the terminal to see . __eou__
The icon has never been up in the top right and it has just suddenly appared O.o __eou__
good luck with your search :) __eou__
tried to get some fancy bash-fu to show only the names , but couldn't find it __eou__
i dont know what that is meant to mean ... __eou__
not sure , thats all i've seen of raid . Ive only used hard raid in linux when i've used raid __eou__ sudo apt-get install gdisk __eou__ xbmcubuntu isn't supported here __eou__ none of the ' ubuntu based ' distributions are supported here __eou__ the installer is called ubiquity __eou__ press CTRL+ALT+F1 __eou__
starting lightdm doesn't work for me , I get the same screen as I was on before . __eou__

usually your isp 's router gives you dns info , and the router has a dns cache , which the hosts on your lan can use __eou__
the url showed on firewall shows iptables howto , also the DROP method ... __eou__

does not look like the card is showing up the OS __eou__
or jus the uninstaller app for the applcation you want to uninstall , just like in windows __eou__ how do you mean ' conf file ? __eou__ not all apps need to have configure ran . Did you check the INSTAL or README files ? __eou__ what are you trying to install ? __eou__ what are you trying to install ? __eou__ is it not in the wine ppa ? __eou__ i found this : http://www.ubuntugeek.com/wibom-manage-wine-program-bottles.html __eou__

I accidentally closed the HD check when I closed the command prompt :( __eou__ also , I bought a hp pavillion ze2000 , and the power plug into it doesn't work .. then I bought a toshiba satellite , and it stopped working for who knows what reason , it wont even make a blip ... and then the dell mini netbook and my studio .. so I have bought other laptops in 12 years , but the old inspiron is the only one i can get to work beside the one i am using right now ! __eou__
it 's based on ubuntu 11 , but they have embedded XBMC onto it __eou__
I would but not sure what to remove everything looks important __eou__
i dont have any ubuntu distros on hands atm , so im of no help __eou__ i have a feeling , that if you would spend all the time you wasted here , reading boot menu of your live cd , you'd find the answer already __eou__
**unknown** to what haha __eou__
if you pastebin lspci I can figure it out __eou__ is your sound not working or something __eou__
it is apart of the alternate live cd __eou__
so whats the issue you can't boot in to windows ? __eou__
to update on my quest to find windows , I pressed shift and saw lots of options and didnt know what to do __eou__
lol G **unknown** __eou__
i do not understand the question __eou__
Sleep is just for the monitor . The harddrive doesn't go to sleep . This is why I'm confused on this . __eou__ Advising users to run as a super account all the time is just pain irresponsible . __eou__
you will be ok with mdadm __eou__
and you will come to realisation , that clean install is faster __eou__
:( __eou__
@yes __eou__
your video card is emulated __eou__
or , **unknown** , in case of built-in sound __eou__
try booting to a rescue shell from cd , 1 way or another you'll have to have grub 's stage1 on the linux partition , not the **unknown** ) __eou__
its not helpfull to tell someone to read docu about something he will maybe never need __eou__ and its not helpfull to name him just a file __eou__
what makes me paranoid is people giving out bad advice . __eou__ Please do not tell people they can run as root all the time . Ubuntu uses sudo and that is what this channel supports __eou__
no __eou__
not trolling , just trying to make light of an -extremely- frustrating problem that has plagued me since I installed 12.04 . it 's really , a dumb problem to have , ( and I may have linked the wrong bug report , they all kinda say the same thing ... ) __eou__
sounds like you want to teach Windows on a broken Linux . Something doesnt sound right here .. __eou__
I am in a folder , but I want to run an executable from another folder in a target folder __eou__ in one line __eou__
ok __eou__
i know that already , that 's what i try to do __eou__
you should be able to do it with the network icon thing on the taskbar __eou__
I get that , .. I'm just trying to say it 's not always about the dbl click . Some users like hearing the second option . Once you only tell them the one way .. i'm sure more than enough users will only stick with this one option .. because they ' know how to do it ' __eou__
if you really want to , yes . Unity is going to be SLOW SLOW SLOW over a network though ... __eou__
help __eou__
ah ! okay . So I guess he doesn't need a new disc , he just needs to choose the " do something else " option to shrink the windows partition __eou__ I think this is a wonderful opportunity to change your habit ... you can definitely succeed __eou__
well , that must be what 's doing it ... everything goes through the kernel on some level __eou__
interesting . any idea why the system might not boot ? __eou__
:) __eou__
win and lin just have their own set of anoying inconveniences __eou__
that doesn't work sometimes when you don't have SU permissions __eou__
ok I ' ll try that __eou__ will let you know shortly . __eou__
anything on the screen ? __eou__
try arandr __eou__
Local they're in my home folder , but I want to bring them over to my remote 's www folder __eou__ But I don't know how to gain permission , I've tried so many ways to get files into that folder .. __eou__

done __eou__
All are installed __eou__
thanks , I remembered something like that but used three dots duh __eou__
are you here ? try " sudo mount -o remount , rw mountpoint " __eou__
cant say ive ever noticed or used autoclean __eou__
will it be remain after reboot . __eou__
the thing is , the **unknown** **unknown** header links to other headers ... i have all the headers , but what can i do ? __eou__
that is for my existing . - . __eou__
you don't have a linux partition __eou__ ah __eou__
the problem is that I wish to use the latest ubuntu version in the live-usb while keeping my media files in anther partition . if I need to format it every few months it 's a bit messy __eou__
it doesn't store graphics anymore ? i see a list of . tgz in /var/log/bootchart/ ( i remember trying it few years ago and it was a . png ) __eou__ sorry , I've looked at bootchart __eou__ ' s files and don't see how to analyse them properly __eou__
normally your bash stuff shows the motd __eou__ should i take a wild guess .. and anonyous users can login . but not normal **unknown** ? __eou__
puuuhh any chance to get gnome 2 back ? __eou__
after installing ntfs-3g it will automount __eou__
that work , but in 11.10 it would tell me how many updates are available when i login __eou__
yeah I've only run Linux on mine for years __eou__ good luck __eou__
so you have just shown its one of your problem users settings or config files that is the issue . __eou__
this is connecting to a windows machine or a linux one ? __eou__
I use the driver which was included in the Ubuntu install , and the Additional Drivers section of the System Settings does not show anything __eou__
no idea . I rarely need apt-on-cd __eou__
I've checked the md5...don't match . could the difference be due to interrupted downloads because of slow internet connection or can this be something that can be manually fixed ? is there a work-around ? __eou__
check /var/log __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Dovecot __eou__
Okkk __eou__
boot live cd , try that boot-repair tool mentioned in the fixgrub url/wiki pages **unknown** . __eou__
no , I could see the folder with pics and downloads . Had to manually transfer them __eou__ agree with **unknown** . let 's continue this in #ubuntu-offtopic __eou__
this might point you in the right direction : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IPv6#Tunneled_IPv6 __eou__

what changes between ls'ing before and after ?.. I'm guessing it 's sdc , but best to be sure __eou__

wht do you use __eou__
Thanks . I figured the 64 bit specific bugs had mostly been resolved in the last couple of years but I thought I would check here first rather than dredging around Launchpad for a couple of hours . __eou__
when u say software raid install am i looking at something complicated or is it very close to standard install __eou__
Again , I tell you , that 's FINE . It 's NOT an nvidia driver , it 's not going to do anything bad . It 's a tool to detect old NVidia drivers and replace them with new ones . __eou__ Read the package description . __eou__
is this a router wifi network ? or dou you mean you made some folder on a windosw7 machine for public access __eou__
only with ubuntu 12.04 : the other versions no problem , you can fix ? __eou__
compare the java versions on working and non working machines . and what java is being used . __eou__
nope , here http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/9527/advancedsetuplanipanddh.png __eou__
there should be a field on your router administration page __eou__
test , I'm sort of beta tester __eou__ I know about that __eou__
whats that ? __eou__
I'm sure ISP don't supply their own dns hosts . I can almost assume google is involved in some way with providing dns to big boys and their subs . __eou__ perhaps a deeper discussion , but that topic doesn't keep the channel on track . __eou__
will you install the silly thing allready and move on .. it wont hurt anything __eou__ i imagine theres dozens of things installed that you may never need also ... __eou__
it keeps my laptop at 1.7 maximum freq and cooler runing up __eou__ in windows works flawless __eou__

install 32bit then __eou__
yeah iptables is the main netfilters interface , but there are other simplier ones like ufw __eou__
almost . Cache can be cleared if ejected . __eou__ can be to hdd . I think video dvd doesn't fit in memory at once . __eou__
bear in mind that many voip apps will provide a bit of " **unknown** " from your microphone to your earpiece __eou__
the point is , they don't run BSD __eou__ that 's not a bad ideal __eou__ isn't it a chroot , rather than vm ? __eou__

so you want more a specific reboot trigger into another Os __eou__ http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/how-to-reboot-in-windows-from-ubuntu.html __eou__
Ah that makes sense why you would want it this way , but you need some sort of control to do this eh . __eou__
ty __eou__
odd i havent had an issue yet . __eou__
gnome classic __eou__ actually apparently 12.04 breaks the force quit applet **unknown** __eou__
Personally I would just pop the cover of the memory and look or look up the model on the web and replacement ram . __eou__ you have top have some patience , waiting 2 mins is not patience , if someone knows they will probably answer __eou__
please , #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to continue this __eou__
can your normal user run that command wihtout permission problems ? __eou__
ahh yeah i'd setup a dualboot setup . Resizing windows and leaving some space on the drive for ubuntu . The installer can walk you through all that . Just defrag your windows drive first . __eou__ I don't own a blackberry but I would search on askubuntu or the forums and see if anyone is having issues with tethering your specific model . __eou__
Where is a good place to ask a packaging question ? Not release-specific -- trying to package something new . __eou__
using synaptic 's " origin " list seems to fit my needs __eou__

i get nothing __eou__ this is weird now the echo works ... but i can not run /usr/sbin/ntpdate server >> **unknown** . txt __eou__
what app causes this issue by the way ? and I'm on about before you removed PA __eou__
that 's right they went with the extension pack thing __eou__ it 's been awhile __eou__
for BlackBerry ? you can throw them on the BB in the right directory and it'll offer to install __eou__
Try to do first ' sudo apt-get update'. Let it follow by ' sudo apt-get upgrade'. Is this successful ? __eou__
&& histo thanks that worked :) __eou__
We could discuss that in more detail . But it would divert from the problem proper . __eou__
it 's possible to mount a filesystem with noexec __eou__ what 's the output of mount for that device ? __eou__
yes __eou__
try : sudo pm-hibernate __eou__
i was on root and created a new user with useradd added them to the admin group then opened `visudo` and added them specifically to the bottom with someprimetime ALL =( ALL ) ALL __eou__
yes :-) much much more space with a 1440p ips monitor __eou__
tbh I'd take a look at it myself but my list of projects is too long as it is __eou__ no , sudo remains active for a few minutes __eou__
i remember one of channel guidelines back from the old days in #debian it said " Don't bother telling us you are a newb or a noob . We can tell ." __eou__ gimp handles both , last i tried it __eou__
I am looking for pros and cons __eou__
okok .. thanks a lot __eou__
i just wanna try on my debian desktop , but thanks , I'm asking on #debian __eou__
hmm well it says it is installed : " ubuntuone-client is already the newest version ." __eou__
then your output would have shown the adobe-flashplugin package __eou__
ssh to remote server . run the app .... __eou__
just did . trying out an alternative at the moment __eou__ sadly Squirrel-sql does not work __eou__
purged the old fglrx drivers & using the floss ones . performance pretty poor - glxgear pretty jittery __eou__
That was my plan , but I unfortantely closed the window with the errors . To try and get the error back I tried reinstalling ubuntuone . It didn't show me the error this time . Only stalled . __eou__ sure , lemee see __eou__ hmm well it says it is installed : " ubuntuone-client is already the newest version ." __eou__ but the icon in unity is the one giving me the error __eou__ where can I set the login options for ubuntuone ? __eou__
o_O __eou__ can you take it to #ubuntu-offtopic please ? __eou__
Thanks . __eou__ What makes it unsuitable ? __eou__
grub is using a res your monitor dosent like . set itto use the TEXT based grub menu in /etc/default/grub __eou__

if MOST of your RAM is used , then your system WILL be slow __eou__ VMs that reserve big chunks of memory would certainly slow your system __eou__

yes , can access it locally without a problem __eou__
ok __eou__ when i try to install libexttextcat-data , later say to remove all libreoffice __eou__
Then you should google ' device name / serie + ubuntu ' __eou__

I use gedit and vim . I talk about learning edit environment **unknown** , drivers , hardware datas etc . __eou__ I want to learn such stuff like this : ( what , why , where , how ) => matts45acp : after that sudo exportfs -ra && sudo /etc/init . **unknown** restart __eou__
do apt-cache search xfce it will list a bunch of packages __eou__
is there one ? __eou__
I won't argue , but it appears to me that it is intrinsically related to the software , and therefore a bug . Sorry . __eou__
depends on the the drive 's internal mass storage controller and the USB connection . if it has at least 2 USB plugs for data , no the difference shouldnt be too significant . expect around 18MB/s average write __eou__
ok i did mkdir **unknown** . now what __eou__ i want that to read and write from this computer __eou__
Yes , but what did it do ..? __eou__
Gparted sounds the easiest way but you may learn more about your system doing other things . __eou__
yeah i'm not finding much on that touchpad __eou__
do about ? __eou__
yeah I have an AMD 8150 fx so second link ? __eou__
because I think I should know how to do it this way :) __eou__
you might want more of an editor and interpreter in one ... something like scite works as an editor and lets you execute your code from inside it __eou__
worth a try __eou__
try : lspci | grep -i athe what is output ? __eou__
idk , I use open source drivers . __eou__
why wouldnt it use the net to ping ?? __eou__
ruby doesn't come included with 10.04 __eou__ which is what I have __eou__ so you might have to install it first __eou__ go to a terminal and type ruby -- version __eou__
I rebooted once ( didn't work ) so I powered off and powered on __eou__ reboot twice may have worked as well . __eou__
yeah that 's exactly what im saying __eou__
known issues ? __eou__ is there a newer version ? perhaps a Beta __eou__
Have you made the usb with a persistent setting ? __eou__ With some usb loaders you can add a file that is called persistent to save what you did on the usb like downloads ... etc . __eou__
nomodeset , what would I do to get to the part where I enter it ? ( if memory serves , isn't it a f# key ? ) __eou__
It booted on windows perfectly , never gotten it to boot with ubuntu __eou__
you said you can boot with nomodeset , so boot with the cd , and edit that file i told you .. so you can do update-grub2 ( do the proper mounts ) __eou__ and do grub-install /dev/sda ( if sda is the right one for you ) __eou__
yes __eou__
the purpose of ssh is to run remote applications .. __eou__ sshd_config supports jailrooting sftp , but not a terminal .. however you can " lock " ssh users to not being able to use a terminal by using /usr/lib/sftp ( i forget the sftp path -- but you can use this sftp path as the user 's login and they never get a bash-like shell ) __eou__
If you're trying to share a shell between multiple people for colaboration , screen should solve your problem completely . If you want to monitor other users without their consent , that 's difficult to do . __eou__
can you recommend anything else ? __eou__
yeah ive had ssh boxes get hacked , luckly they were not inportant __eou__
thanks for that info . i will look into that , thanks . __eou__
cli can do anything __eou__
Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB __eou__ and AMD Radeon HD **unknown** __eou__
you sure can is also have some sort of USB device __eou__ as long as your computer support booting from Usb __eou__
cool ... thanks so much ! __eou__
: I think you your first boot devise is usb , not ssd , you should set you bois . __eou__
dumb simple : chntpwd is an utility to change windows passwd , while it 's a good tool to have in a rescue live system , the ubuntu live image is not meant for that , so expect to have only a _very_ small subset of packages available in those 700mb __eou__
i need only one pkg chntpw ... can i just install it using dpkg if i drop the deb file on the usb of the live cd ?? __eou__
do i need to upload it to internet and download it again ? __eou__
- . - __eou__ art software __eou__
you will need to modify the sudoers file for both systems __eou__
yeah and I would **unknown** love to be able the open it again __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
because you always post when people go off topic i wanted to make sure you stayed on ;) __eou__
yes there is a key , it tried it and no luck __eou__
that just gives me a blank screen , then when I go back to the tty it shows " Waiting for X server to begin connections " and " No protocol specified " __eou__
/dev/mapper means your running in a RAID format . That 's your devices __eou__
fakeraid is what a lot of vendors use on their motherboards as " raid " functionality .. it 's not real hardware raid , kinda like a sudo software raid __eou__ it 's different from linux md software raid __eou__
It 's not a lot of settings , it 's changing exactly one setting in the ethernet settings pane saying " this interface should be used for sharing internet ". And if you get something wrong you can simply create a new connection and everything will be automagic . __eou__
ok if you want to computers to access shared connection through ethernet you'll need to modify UFW __eou__ it 's the Uncomplicated Fire Wall __eou__ try that then . should be really easy . __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing#GUI_Method_via_Network_Manager_.28Ubuntu_9.10_and_up.29 __eou__
nah i seem to be set . thanks mate . __eou__
i have absolutely no idea __eou__
Network Manager provides a GUI which allows sharing an internet connection to any available interface . I've shared to ethernet ( from a 3G modem ) multiple times . __eou__
stumbled upon that wondering __eou__
whats good and its generally too basic __eou__
mmm :) ? __eou__
how is not disabling network manager crippling the machine ? __eou__
yes ... 15 years __eou__
start the job at 2:17 , and then repeat every 3 hours afterwards . __eou__
create a list of the element names in a text file , and do something like " for i in `cat **unknown** ; do cp mytemplate $i . element ; done __eou__ that'll create your list of files but it won't populate them __eou__
is it supported as well as the 32bit packages ? __eou__
it 's a fork from 11.10 - called XMBCbuntu __eou__
how will it know where to find " wall "? __eou__ you could try that __eou__ echo might be a built-in command __eou__ that 's true of all OSes ;-) __eou__
sudo $editor $file __eou__
well if the information is that limited and static i wouldnt set up a dbms thats for sure __eou__
/whois will tell you . __eou__
it will be more confusing to program and I have to study other subjects also __eou__
i tried chroot ... without the bin/bash __eou__ bazhang : mmmm __eou__
even gdisk ? __eou__
then re-install for apache/mythtv __eou__
hold on a moment , let me paste a couple things to ya __eou__
fix for what , I've not been following __eou__ need some details __eou__ this is ethernet ? __eou__
I had some funky issues with GPT and Ubuntu a week or so ago __eou__
That 's not evidence __eou__
exactly __eou__
i have a couple __eou__
it has happened to me once , identical cards by identical manufacturer __eou__
3 gb left out of 140gb __eou__
? __eou__ yes .. the prob is the machine does not have net access :-( __eou__ how do i tell apt-get to just generate a script ? __eou__ thanks dude __eou__
yes I get you now __eou__
small odds but not impossible __eou__
you broke the universe . __eou__
thanks man __eou__
MonkeyDust , thanks . the partitioning wiki page doesn't mention much to do with SSDs specifically though __eou__
darn ... someone told me they had more packages than the desktop __eou__ i need to find if chntpw is part of desktop/alternate __eou__
Then remove gnome ? What 's the meta-package for that ? __eou__ Removing gnome i'd guess could be quite a hassle __eou__ Then remove gnome ? What 's the meta-package for that ? / __eou__
Thanks , I'm going to try it :) Hope to keep my desktop alive after that . __eou__
yeah it sucks . But it 's still Xorg oriented . Not sure what it will mean for Ubuntu when it jumps ship for Wayland . __eou__
what is " sleep 180 " __eou__ ok now i get __eou__ so now i have to configure the startup at sleep 180 __eou__
: what ? i cant understand that , my english is too bad __eou__
most ppl don't think about the " environment " as you call it , they just want it to work , and linux has become a boogeyman OS due to horror stories about hardware problems and purist OSs like gentoo for example __eou__ anyway that 's my thought for the day :) __eou__
well .. you just answered .. if its only flash , you have to unmute .. __eou__
having a crack at it myself __eou__ it compiled cleanly on my machine .. ubuntu 12.04 64bit __eou__
bummer __eou__ which of the 25,000 or so sound cards known to exist do you have ? __eou__
at your service sir :) __eou__ did you got that __eou__
so boot from live cd and ' try ubuntu ' and from terminal install grub ? __eou__
thanks . __eou__
Both approaches do call the same mechanism to remove/purge software , so there is no difference . __eou__
you've done something else __eou__ can you please do this command " sudo fdisk -l " and pastebin it please . __eou__
that gives tthe error " you must specity the filesystem type " __eou__
point taken . my apologies __eou__
Wubi is best tested on English Windows builds __eou__ It 's not designed with every language tested __eou__
According to the pastebin , the files that you're trying to remove are ' read only ' on the USB . Perhaps if you prefix your rm command with sudo ; or if there 's nothing on the USB that you need to keep , just format the USB , with gparted form a LiveCD , __eou__
don't poke the twat __eou__
No problem ! __eou__
ive upgraded my kernel before and had no problems with nvidia driver from nvidia.com __eou__

I think I got it fixed ( temporarily I guess) , I used $sudo umount . gvfs and then opened my home folder __eou__
working on it though im just wondering how i copy it to usb __eou__
excellent __eou__
it 's not an ubuntu release - it 's nothing to do with canonical/ubuntu/this channel . __eou__
okie 1 min __eou__
Okay , apparently something changed within the USB after the install , I'm formatting it and trying again . Thanks for the help ! __eou__
mom and dad aren't clever enough __eou__
no such option , I have seached every piece of it __eou__ wilee-nilee one question , how should I set the partitions on this disk . One for the current windows , and one for the iso of the linux .... __eou__ I know , __eou__
yes , and where does it say it 's released , or you can buy it , in actually anything about it __eou__ **unknown** 's not released __eou__ it 's a concept canonical are working on / trying to create __eou__
cool . __eou__

did you try the answer posted __eou__
I doubt that will work there is a app called plop on the web for booting usb 's on computers to old to have that bios option . __eou__ http://www.plop.at/ __eou__
the sudo command does not work it says app not found . __eou__ miro is available in the software center __eou__
I think you can either reboot or unload and reload the alsa modules . __eou__
yes been there done that :) __eou__
I'm not sure what you mean . If you mean I can access http://myhost.com and the apache2 service running on port 80 , yes . __eou__
i see __eou__
wilee-nilee , ikonia THANKS :D __eou__
that forum thread is what you were asking about I believe __eou__
No . Use a / instead of the \ __eou__
well im not sure blacklisted a lot of stuff , my thought is ipv6 __eou__
please be helpful when helping , or stick to getting your own problem solved , there 's no need to make others life more difficult . __eou__
Already told you how __eou__
it takes a real man to do so ... i respect that __eou__

I'm not exactly sure what you mean ... You installed win7 & win 8 together ( dual boot) . Now you uninstalled one ( or both) ? And now you want to install ubuntu on top of that ? __eou__
sorry should have asked to pastebin it , I am mostly interested in the url near the bottom __eou__
That 's the easy bit that I was able to figure out myself :) __eou__
I don't want the menu bar there __eou__
You still may be able to use lsof to look for anything accessing /run/rpc_pipefs __eou__
I forget that HTML5 is slowly replacing flash but there are still compatibility issues with HTML5 aren't there ? __eou__
If you are feeling adventurous , you might try installing it in PlayOnLinux . I have no idea if it will work . Your other option is to set up a Windows VM and run it in there . __eou__

yes , java is a risk __eou__

im just afraid now that gaming just has a chance of taking off on linux , we now just suddenly toss everything around . i know a lot of people in the wild that just got used to version 8 , 9 and 10 after ditching windows vista and now they have UI experiments thrown at them both from Ubuntu mainline and Metro __eou__

apt-cache depends -i somepackage | cut -f 2 -d ':' | tr ' \n ' ' '. __eou__ this should show all dependencies of a package in a nice form __eou__ i thought it might be useful __eou__ so you can purge the packages easily . __eou__

you can also reconfigure packages that are installed dpkg-reconfigure < package name > __eou__
However , **unknown** , 10.10 is already , itself , beyond EOL for support . __eou__ I'd say so . __eou__ Your upgrade path isn't direct though . __eou__ You will have to install 11.04 , 11.10 , then 12.04 __eou__
Do you have a link for it ? __eou__
network card is not being detected __eou__ and I'm having trouble mounting my USB flash drive __eou__ but those are problems for another day . I just wish I could figure out what 's causing it to be not detected __eou__

did you see the first answer to the question ( about fgrlx being blacklisted) ? the solution doesn't require you to have an xorg . conf __eou__
**unknown** : i dont mean the apple like cairo dock . I upgraded from 11.04 with the classic gnome and there was the application bar on top and the window bar at the bottom __eou__ **unknown** : like this **unknown** __eou__
lsb-release will show the version __eou__
that could be dbus or something with your network __eou__ either way thats a whole lot of hurt __eou__

I'm all okay with Android and all , but if I had a choice to run fully functional Ubuntu on a tablet like my 10 " Toshiba **unknown** , I'd be much more FOR that . __eou__

I did , and ~/ . gvfs looked the most likely __eou__
I have just bought a new battery for an old laptop , it works fine , just not the indicator __eou__ it is desktop environment which handles battery icon ? I have lxde __eou__
theres only the ATI drivers in the repos , and the fglrx drivers .. __eou__
maybe have a look at acpitool , to change the fan back to auto __eou__
that is where i'm headed . __eou__ I think I would not make the jump , but do each release one at a time . __eou__
the type of monitor wouldent matter .. the video codec could . __eou__
tried fscking manually ? __eou__
isn't that a webservice ? __eou__
you could try to use gparted . but it depends on how many primary partitions etc ... you have . just give it a try __eou__
making a fresh profile will isolate plugin issues / profile as the cause of the issues __eou__
What do you reckon I should choose in the installation : " Install driver ***** on X . Org **** or later " or " Generate Distribution Specific Driver Package "? __eou__
all good then ;) __eou__
not good , you don't have hardware 3D acceleration . __eou__
I'll do that , but for now I'd like to get this over with , how do I do it to simply run a . run program ? __eou__

I would start with https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair __eou__ did you have a working linux install ? Or is it simply not booting from the cd ? __eou__
What about for DB ? __eou__
? __eou__
its not there __eou__ that is for a typical unix system __eou__
newcomers ( not saying explicitly you) , don't know what a " share " is , technically is a jargon word , referring to the access nodes on the server __eou__ dovecot is good stuff , it 's quite flexible too __eou__
then /etc/init . **unknown** restart __eou__
i was trying to deal with windows shares with someone yesterday .. I tested again last night , there 's no issues mounting shares from windows being accessed from linux __eou__ the text boxes are tricky in nautilus .. it 's one or two that can be confusing . __eou__ but it 's doable , provided 1 ) your credentials are correct and 2 ) the network firewalls ( and other network settings ) are allowed this from both Oses __eou__
last thing , do you think that if i untar the backup of the 8.04 , which is the last working version , it will replace the criple working 10.04 and we'll try to forget all about this fail ? __eou__
you need bandwidth for attaching the machines , you'll gain less if accessing them is slow __eou__
yup __eou__

the debugger from **unknown** / LLVM __eou__
Obvious question , having read that tutorial . You are launching it using " **unknown** " not " u1sdtool " are you ? __eou__ OK ... was the obvious hiccup if you've added that but not logged out/in to get the new PATH __eou__
Eternity :p __eou__
Good point , thank-you . It 's the obvious assumptions that often trip us up . __eou__
! **unknown** __eou__
when will that be ? __eou__
are you running it ? __eou__ I can't seem to get gnome 3 going . It always gives me the gnome fallback and unity . __eou__
ok , here is the article : http://askubuntu.com/questions/33605/can-i-move-the-unity-launcher __eou__
If you over-wrote it , its gone I'm afraid __eou__ You might be in luck then ! __eou__ You're too late - my boyfriend got there first :p __eou__
Thanks . :) __eou__
Well the -dev packages are **unknown** . But when installing packages you can use the suffix : amd64 or : i386 to force the architecture you require __eou__ Not sure if that works for build-deps though __eou__
thanks __eou__
Gnome terminal is just a terminal emulator for X windows . you're still using a shell . try echo $SHELL __eou__

Allright , I'll get on to that when I reboot into ubuntu . Thanks __eou__ http://pastebin.com/wAm408K5 Here is " sudo fdisk -l " regarding drive marked as RAW in windows but seems to be working in ubuntu . The drive in question is /dev/sda . Looks like it is reporting as a Guid Partition table rather than NTFS __eou__
too bad __eou__
I'm not sure what you're asking . Please ask specifically what you need in one line :) __eou__
you could to jamar . He has the problem , and I would love any suggestions I can get . :) __eou__ I was going to have him run dmesg | grep sr0 and see if it says device not ready . __eou__
There we go , thanks __eou__
no problem . I'm thinking that as paranoid as I can be sometimes , Ubuntu may not be the best suited ;P __eou__
fwiw ... it 's freenode.net __eou__
i don't know how to do that . i could try and google it . __eou__ no desktop environment . openbox is very very basic . it runs grpahical apps , but is very very light on resources . __eou__ i believe so , __eou__
Is the drive in an external **unknown** ? __eou__
yah __eou__
I did type the nick thing , but it won't work . __eou__
I'm now using xfce session . it 's pretty cool . __eou__

i can try , but I am no wiz . let 's take a crack at it though . __eou__
you want to put the window controls on the right , in Unity ? ( the desktop that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 ? ) __eou__
ok ... __eou__
ok , so xubuntu is the best one to install . __eou__
I've tried both ways . Right now I have onboard disabled and am using a soundcard __eou__ That 's what 's strange about this . It 's cross OS , and I get a stutter with every different sound card I've tried . __eou__ I had some suggestions a while back , I actually recognize a username or two on here right now . We worked through the normal fixes for sound problems , but I didn't notice the mouse thing until today . This is the oddest problem I've ever had . Do you think it could be **unknown** interference from the way the drive cables are running in my case ? __eou__ I'm going to unplug some stuff and reboot . See if that helps my sound . __eou__
your standard **unknown** **unknown** , but I thought I might try to run some games in WINE __eou__
let me explain what I am trying to do , I am trying to get themes to work on Ubuntu 12.04 , a lot of them are not showing up in the appearance section of Ubuntu under the Themes section , they are listed as GTK 2 and GTK 3 Themes , I want themes that work on Ubuntu 2D ( default , which is what I'm using ) __eou__
ram __eou__ yes __eou__
Yeah I got that installed .... but I can't seem to view flash vids in Chrome __eou__
:) __eou__
no , this is a 32 bit machine , and since it is running , I doubt that I installed the 64 bit version ... __eou__
you need to enable the partner repository in software center-edit-sources-other software __eou__
thanks __eou__
That is a brilliant idea . could you please advise me on memtest86+ ? I have no experience with it . __eou__ By the way , here is my issue in detail http://superuser.com/questions/469677/upgrading-ram-on-ubuntu-12-04-caused-major-hardware-failure if you dont mind looking into it __eou__
I was thinking of using jsut regular Ubuntu . Should I be using Ubuntu Server ? I currently run a shell server on my mac .. But I have to manually put the files in . I don't know how to set up SSH or do everything accordingly so I am switching to Ubuntu . __eou__
What ? No . I was explaining why I thought the library problem was an Ubuntu issue and not a generic Linux one . **unknown** the uname screen : http://i.imgur.com/fXzfg.png __eou__
Huh ? __eou__
was afk . Yes , they do an excellent job with HD decoding . Very low CPU utilization __eou__
its as literal as can be , do you see an intel GPU and an AMD GPU ? __eou__
there is a channel for ' generic linux issues ' it 's #linux __eou__ this is for Ubuntu specific issues only __eou__ each distribution of GNU Linux has it 's own channel __eou__
**unknown** welcome __eou__
Yes you need to learn simple script handling and usage . __eou__
=( __eou__ alternatives ? __eou__
its advisable to pay attention to whats going on in the channel before making yourself look stupid __eou__ scroll up and reada while if you need to __eou__ you can appologize in private for acting childish btw __eou__
what version of ubuntu are u using ? __eou__ sorry . that command will likely only work in gnome __eou__ u might try to edit the " gnome-open %u " with " **unknown** %u " __eou__ http://askubuntu.com/questions/138705/run-shell-script-from-launcher-with-root-permissions __eou__ after u get gnome installed go here : http://www.nfotechs.com/change-start-menu-icon __eou__ put this command exactly in the gnome launcher ( copy and paste) : gksudo " gnome-open %u " __eou__

I need help getting my dell mini netbook with ubuntu 10.04 to connect to to my TV via hdmi . its not recognizing the external monitor of my tv . my graphics card is Intel Corporation System Controller Hub ( **unknown** Poulsbo ) Graphics Controller ( rev 07) . __eou__
i did unthinkable things like compile my own kernel and then used official installer too __eou__
I cant even access the files .. __eou__
then sudo chown root folder ; sudo chmod 755 folder ; sudo chmod -w folder/* __eou__
i'd just clean install then . Restore user data from backup __eou__
may I know how to underclock my cpu __eou__
I got this chmod : changing permissions of **unknown** Operation not permitted __eou__

I have 2 branches to login to ( actually more ) Ubuntu , which I am using currently , Gnome , Gnome Classic , and Ubuntu2D , when I login to Gnome , the only selection on top is Applications __eou__
Okay , let me try again . __eou__ Worked like a charm , thank you . __eou__
You need to pay attention to the instructions that came with the download , and/or refer to the source site . __eou__
I think I reinstalled the ubuntu restricted extras package recently and it coincides with when the errors started __eou__ I can't remove ubuntu-restricted-extras , I need it to play videos and music __eou__
I followed your advice , but I had to try anyway just in case all it needed was a simple reboot __eou__
I went ahead and ran mcelog anyway just to see what it does , and I get " mcelog : warning : 16 bytes ignored in each record " " mcelog : consider an update " __eou__
depends how/why it 's been corrupted __eou__
I find Unity gives my mouse more exercise - stops it getting fat ; with multiple HiDef monitors it spends a lot of time running up to the top of screens and back down t the lower right quadrant for some programs :D __eou__
I told you to read the ssh daemon 's manual . __eou__ it should telll you how to stop it . __eou__
i see your point . I think you are right , I couldn't find a single library which will be useful for this purpose . __eou__
their purpose is to get around the issue . __eou__
adblock plus and noscript are superior ;) __eou__
have you tried a clean prefix __eou__
Is it new ? __eou__
What more could I do to clearly address the issue/ __eou__
i thought the goal was to get nvidia working ? __eou__
You're being ridiculous .. __eou__
i had a similar problem tonight :) __eou__ well the problem is my front usbs don't give enough power , dunno about your issue __eou__
If windows is fine and Linux isn't - that 's a kernel bug . Sounds like it 's not correctly configuring the USB controller __eou__
exactly __eou__
i have a program which is located in folder x , i want to add folder x to path so i can access it without its " address " in bash __eou__
yeah im trying to use actual cds __eou__ got it __eou__
you can bug the manufacturers to better support linux __eou__
despite how irrelevant ? .. Even If I did have the answers . Turning my question into something with an answer that bites .. I'd keep my information . __eou__
what app ? __eou__
I used . **unknown** . sh to open it , and : __eou__ **unknown** :/ **unknown** . **unknown** . sh __eou__

I don't really want it in the desktop , just at the sidebar of Unity , how can I create an installer ? ( Or where can I learn that ? ) __eou__ The problem isn't what , but how __eou__
It 's a common requirement for those of us using multi-monitor multi-GPU setups __eou__
then upgrade your software __eou__
a space between . and the rest __eou__ just a . not with ' music ' following __eou__
In other words , a file-system is just a way of organising data on a disk . That can be corrupted but it doesn't damage the disk itself . We want to know if the disk physically believes it has failures __eou__ What did it report ? __eou__ If the disk believes it is healthy , this could be a fault with the USB-to-SATA interface inside the drive enclosure . I've had that happen to me multiple times __eou__ Short will do for now __eou__ Does it report the overall SMART status as healthy or something else ? __eou__ Disks are designed to tolerate a few bad sectors and they reserve spare sectors to be used to replace bad sectors . But if too many sectors are going bad the disk runs out of spares ... and as ThinkT510 says , it 's probably time to get a new disk and try to recover as much as possible __eou__ Mounting a file-system is not the same thing as the OS seeing the drive . the OS sees it as /dev/sdb . You can use recovery tools to scan the physical device /dev/sdb and recovery as much as it can ( I suggested earlier you'd use " photorec " for that ) __eou__ Not unusual . If you're storing important data , you'd be best off using multiple disk-drives configured as a mirror array at a minimum . That ensures that at least 2 drives both have copies of everything __eou__
, what is a good size for the partition for ms ? __eou__
ok . __eou__ even can we download commercial videos ?? i am subscribing to a commercial company which provides training videos online . I want to download them . Can i even download the contents if it has strict security restrictions about downloading videos ? __eou__
try to always ask the channel ... not a single user ;) __eou__
that's... odd , thanks . wish ubuntu or chromium gave me some sort of alert that I am running a 4-version-old build >_> __eou__
ty __eou__
same here , i'm not familiar enough with wine __eou__
yes only software i had installed was eclipse __eou__
thanks __eou__
ah yeah .. no idea . haha __eou__ i always make the swap roughly around the same size as my ram amount __eou__
also there i see no errors related to my problem http://pastebin.ca/2200929 __eou__
does it have channels available to it ? like say a channel that plays a style of music __eou__
yes , soon after the download the installation aborted __eou__
i dont come here with questions , i help people __eou__
so the bottom line is that the groups are important for the system and its security , but you don't generally need to add users to them individually in general __eou__ I think your best approach is to create a dummy user , and test its access to see if you're happy with it __eou__
it 's a USB device that I plugged a SSD drive into , and it makes it appear as a USB device on my system __eou__ after installing ubuntu on it , I'll remove the ssd and install it into a netbook __eou__ can I mount the ubuntu cd , then run the installer from ubuntu __eou__ and install it to another hard disk ? __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
well don't use xampp __eou__ use the packages in the /official/ repositories __eou__
you might just want to use the gui based user management if available , it should have descriptive checkboxes instead of cryptic group names __eou__
thanks __eou__
i need to make a copy of Floppix for a VERY old laptop __eou__
the boot-repair live cd is also handy for that __eou__
if grub is thinking it sees a file-system that may be because it 's looking further than just the first sector __eou__ Did you create a partition within one of the partitions ? I'm a little hazy on the exact state of the device . __eou__
thanks __eou__
use gparted to partition the drive in question than just install ubu via iso or usb ? .. Is this what ur asking __eou__
hehehe :) __eou__
i dont get it , but i try it out . one sec :) __eou__ intersting . thanks for the hint . __eou__
haha , ic ouldn't recall the name ! thanks __eou__ **unknown** __eou__ ... not convinced . __eou__
it occupies space on the disk to have the MBR __eou__
Chrome and Chromium __eou__
so if : apt-cache search sysstat isag - Interactive System Activity Grapher for sysstat sysstat - sar , iostat and mpstat - system performance tools for Linux it means i can get it ? __eou__
do you know if there are firewall settings on the android device ?? __eou__ because google says this error comes up with wrong firewall settings __eou__
ok let me check __eou__ thanx , I found it and I activated it and I can access the files now __eou__
you should always use the package manager ( apt-get/aptitude , software center , synaptic ) to make those sorts of changes - doing things manually like you did makes it very difficult and time-consuming to recover . I would actually consider backing up your data and reinstalling if I were you :-/ __eou__
cannot do that .. once window comes up .. cannot de-select the option .. __eou__
helpful , thank you __eou__
still outdated __eou__
thanks , 7zip sounds more interesting , i have installed it quite few times on WinPCs __eou__
cli access only __eou__

sorry - I misunderstood what you meant by backing up __eou__ in the software center it 's File -> Sync between computers ... __eou__
I think it 's in 12:04 . Can't check because my machine here runs an older version . __eou__ in that case the " ubottu " solution above is best . But you may have some mismatches , when package names have changed . Still , it 's a good start . __eou__
http://system.pc-fault.com/system/8260.html Hope this can help you . __eou__
thats what I needed to know . Thanks ! __eou__
thank you for the pointers . no , there 's nothing there about flash , either . __eou__

Are you trying to install ubuntu using Wubi __eou__
Any log entries to indicate the issues it 's having ? Have you tried starting into the initrd by setting " break=top " and working you way through the initrd manually to see what 's going wrong ? __eou__
Well , now you've got me wondering , but I'm pretty sure that is how it gets configured on Debian/Ubuntu . I had to do " mount -- rbind /home/Library **unknown** " in fstab to do " **unknown** " in exportfs __eou__
sorry , didn't mean to be rude in any way , just a lil ' bit mad and angry because this is stupid . __eou__ ok , and what would I need to give that user access to ? __eou__
ok , then why if I try to connect to a password protected network , with a regular ( non-admin ) user , asks me for the password for a user with administrator rights __eou__
sorry that was meant for andreb __eou__
I did press ^X __eou__

would help to know which one .. took a look at /etc/group and nothing pop my eyes . __eou__
i'll check that out . __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ the last time there was a conflict issue with drivers and if I recall I had to install a propritary Intel driver and uninstall something else ? __eou__

hehe :) __eou__
wifi doesnt work in my 12.04 __eou__

That depends on your graphics card . There 's plenty of resources to be found through Google . __eou__ Though Ubuntu has a fair bit of native hardware support , so there 's also the chance the problem is something else , like conflicting drivers or simple misidentification __eou__
no only " admin " __eou__
i'm not too sure , how can i check that ? __eou__
/etc/modprobe . **unknown** . conf *should* load your sound modules __eou__

ahh what about asuming root with the script and then executing it 's commands . like sudo -i in the begining then all commands after that . __eou__
this is correct for sudo . But gksudo does not save the " session key " or whatever it is called __eou__
if it was hardware it wouldnt show up in a screenshot __eou__

I think you're just looking at the solution from the wrong angle - you need to mock a DHCP server when one isn't present and keep your client config using DHCP always - possible if you simply bridge the interfaces on the local box . It 's all a bit of a mess regardless though . __eou__

it can still connect to and communicat with the IRC servce in the RFC agreed way __eou__ so its an IRC client __eou__
is it #thunderbird ? __eou__
http://keepmecompanypetsitters.co.uk/cloud-hosting/blocking-unwanted-websites-or-url-using-iptables/ __eou__ I used : https://duckduckgo.com/?q=iptables+block+website __eou__ could use /etc/hosts to resolve the site to 127.0 . 0.1 __eou__
:) __eou__
Thanks __eou__
look at the files .. most are not tmux related .. they got tmux in the name .... __eou__ and i said earlier that the package manager tools do NOT touch files in the users home dirs __eou__
its not for you . Sorry bro ! __eou__
type vimtutor in a shell __eou__ it 's a way to learn vim ;P __eou__
theres are only vi and vim here . No nano :-( __eou__
how do u create bootable disk from the existing ubuntu 12.04 __eou__ i dont have the image __eou__ and i'm in need __eou__
about 25 people in #bpython __eou__
i belive so __eou__
Can you elaborate ? I don't fully understand why x number of sectors waiting to be remapped causes the OS not to boot in the first place . __eou__
ya it will be fine after a format , make sure to send it to the root of the device __eou__ so lets say the drive is at /dev/sdb1 you are going to use " dd if =/ **unknown** of =/ dev/sdb " __eou__
in a terminal you can type man getch __eou__
That 's probably why __eou__
thank you __eou__
oke thanks , the third screen does show a desktop but i cant control it yet __eou__
this not works , I really tried __eou__
theres tools to remaster a current install to cd/dvd .. but its not trivial . ;) and can be a trial and error process __eou__
the LED doesnt glow or respond __eou__ : no difference .. shall i pastebin it ? __eou__
yes , going to do that ( update bug report) . __eou__
no string matches for " splash " ... and the only thing with " quiet " is GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=true __eou__
ssh -X username@server instead of : ssh username@server __eou__ notice the X is capitalized __eou__ if you connect in that manner , you can run GUI apps and they will run on the server side but show on the client ( much like Citrix does) . Its slow over WWW but works __eou__ its the same as being on the local system too so you will be manipulating the settings of the user you run the command with __eou__
lvm snapshots tend to be expensive __eou__ I don't think I would do it every day __eou__ I would probably do an xfs snapshot and then back that up __eou__
Ubuntu can run on touchscreen devices . __eou__
: ll try n tell ya __eou__
I'm not try to create a directory . after mounting my ext4 partition . I'm try to create a folder inside it .. __eou__ create folder option is not active inside the mounted folder . __eou__
h22turbo these look like its going to take some time ... is there a command line command I can issue to simply shut down the GUI ... and go to CLI only ? __eou__
no problem __eou__
the postinst scripts are there usually for good reasons , if a package has them , you should not remove them unless absolutely necessary , and you can only remove them by removing them from the package . That 's part of dpkg 's processes , and the format of packages ... __eou__
: what should i do now ? will it fix the issue ? __eou__
Neither does the postinst script it seems :P :) __eou__ I could let chef ' install itself ' but then it does something bogus ... it installs a new copy of ruby + gems + chef in /opt/ __eou__ and runs from there __eou__ I've already preped images with chef client installed ... but I need to keep the client in sync with the server __eou__ As far as versions , in any case __eou__
did you disable it ? __eou__
What I like is , it 's still part of the Ubuntu family with access to everything the big bad CPU/GPU guzzling Unity desktop :) __eou__ First one , I did a debootstrap side-by-side ... for the others , a network install from a PXE server __eou__ a USB stick with the ISO CD image on it is simplest for you I'd think __eou__ It depends on whether those systems will boot from USB ... older devices sometimes won't __eou__
I can't remove the data :P __eou__ I mean I can __eou__ but it 's necessary __eou__ the bulk of it is preallocated MongoDB files __eou__
thanks ;) __eou__
yes , didn't know the command :) __eou__
and your video card is ? __eou__
I guess that might be an issue , heh thanks . __eou__
there is no set time for any of our releases . ISOs need to be tested , etc , so when they're all working to the release manager 's satsifaction then the release will be done . __eou__
why my pc crash ? __eou__
ok , I did and ? How do I test it ? __eou__
nope __eou__ aptitude remove gnome-games ? __eou__
ubuntu just aliases ls to " ls -- **unknown** " __eou__
how do I " get rid of pulseaudio " __eou__ I have been asking since monday in here and in #alsa and nobody has replied __eou__ I would really like a way to " test drive " the updates and see if they break my system , or a way to undo __eou__
/etc/apt/sources . list contains all the official repositories , one per line . Lines starting with # are ignored . __eou__ http://repogen.simplylinux.ch can help you regenerate a sources . list for your needs __eou__
The theme is not listed . __eou__ It uses unico . __eou__
there is a minimal CD ? You mean alternate CD ? __eou__
wait , wut ? nano does coloring on Ubuntu ? That's... new to me __eou__
: trying to scan sensors .. doesnt seem to show up .. i only see my GPU __eou__
i get an error when I do that __eou__
with ubuntu ? uncomment the force colo line in ~/ . bashrc __eou__ for nano http://how-to.wikia.com/wiki/How_to_use_syntax_highlighting_with_the_GNU_nano_text_editor __eou__
Ah , not an area I'm real familiar with but it would be about permissions overall I suspect . __eou__
Not really . On windows they are used to open configuration menu __eou__ Strangely , they are showing as Super_L on xev __eou__
thanks for the link __eou__
install gnome-shell , logout , select gnome-shell , login __eou__
Thank you . __eou__ gnome-shell is already installed . __eou__ How do I activate gnome-shell ? __eou__
Ubuntu uses Debian-Exp debs if I recall __eou__ I am sure if you hunt on google you can find custom repos with updated nagios , regardless if the program doesn't have a bug or a security issue don't see the need to update . __eou__
I am special HAHAHA ! __eou__ hehehe *slap* __eou__ Okay , will do now ... see you ina few minutes . __eou__
nope not yet , is there a log file ? __eou__
I've reinstalled many times and it either makes it worse ( borks bootloader ) or does nothing . I might try a console installation next , if it 's not too hard . __eou__
See what dmesg says when you plug in the HD if nothing shows up then figure out why __eou__
thanks ... i'll try it ... __eou__
Nisstyre-laptop , I think its the tifm module , which seems to be loaded : tifm_7xx1 12937 0 __eou__ Nisstyre-laptop , how do I know what the right module is ? __eou__ http://pastebin.ca/2201882 syslog showed me that __eou__
**unknown** yes the usb is insterted and when i choose my boot option it says " boot error " __eou__
I think for laptops the main thing is to future-proof as much as possible by ensuring it has decent MXM support __eou__
well at least you can get it back to where you were before you started hacking __eou__
no google told me it was tifm module , I dont know anything else __eou__
i need to do this for one Redhat & one Ubuntu VM __eou__
oh :) of course :p thanks brb i hope __eou__
do have any advice for installing ubuntu via flashdrive bc im at a loss and i have no way to make a boot cd ( small town library doesnt permit putting cd 's or flash drives in there machines ) __eou__
that looks like it would be perfect __eou__
YES . Thanks . __eou__
no I don't have a backup __eou__
np __eou__
Can you get the DEB for the package you need to install ? __eou__
i think I tried that once and it didn't work __eou__
says it 's a upnp client-> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UPnP_AV_media_servers_and_clients#Linux __eou__
... is this a clean system ? Did you previously do something funny regarding apache ? __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
Good for most things I think , Intel focus on general workloads not high-performance though __eou__
The proof of concept already works ... they just need to tidy it up and get Dave Arlie to sign off on it __eou__
thanks . I know those are unsupported , but should I expect them to work without issues ? __eou__
Currently cannot think of any simpler way to do everything at once(rm *) __eou__
I did use sudo . Everything 's fine , dandy and updated now __eou__
oh .. that 's true . i haven't even tried to log in as a different user . __eou__
geforce 6150se nforce 430 __eou__
Not sure I understand that . __eou__ I intepret that as **unknown** . 1.2 as a source address and **unknown** . 1.21 as a destination . __eou__
YOu might try reseting unity with unity -- reset with a alt-f2 prompt , not the terminal . __eou__
it just gives me 2 options 1024x768 and 800x600 . dr_willis i'm running an nvidia chipset with the current-updates driver running __eou__
thanks __eou__
yes __eou__ ubuntu 12.04 installed just fine for me , though __eou__
I had a gnome 3 only release there is at least one out there . __eou__ I have a debian wheezy install with just gnome 3 as well seems stable , just another option . __eou__
sounds like you might be using the wrong install images __eou__
mm .. maybe you're right . i think the netboot minimal iso could work . http://www.webupd8.org/2012/05/how-to-install-ubuntu-1204-on-non-pae.html __eou__ 32 bit without pae extension __eou__ i know it 's 32bit . __eou__
for grub , i think not differ too much __eou__ good morning guys __eou__
the problem is that lucid is only " supported until April 2013 ". so i don't know what i'm going to do next year . __eou__
i first saw that now that it searched for an ipv6 router that wasn't there __eou__ i read about a few issues due to missing ipv6 routers __eou__
yeah , that 's what I mean . su to root __eou__ Is there a way to activate it ? __eou__
Yes , I have , Anything I do just changes how loud the static is . __eou__
what about vuze ? __eou__
It 's not an alias AFAIK __eou__ I don't how it is implemented __eou__
i switched to the version 295 driver and now i'm in 1024x768 but i know this monitor does 1280x1024 i had ubuntu installed and working fine but it crapped out on me after in installed my new hard drive and reinstalled ubuntu . why would it work fine in one install but not fine on another ? __eou__ under displays it has my monitor listed as laptop for some reason __eou__
If you did " rm * " the shell would expand that to " rm file1 file2 file3 ..." and there is a limit to the number of args you can pass in the shell . But that may not be your problem __eou__ Doing as jrib asked would be helpful __eou__ You can probably use find and -exec as a workaround __eou__
the question is how do I reset my display settings to be as it was when I installed Ubuntu __eou__ and no I didnt tried recovery __eou__ I can get to the prompt using CTRL-ALT F1 __eou__
did you understand what we ae talking about ? is about torrent protocol on direct stream __eou__

glad to help __eou__ " Kernel driver not installed " suggests the **unknown** . personally , i'd purge vbox . __eou__
any way to prevent problems ? __eou__
so you mean if I install ubuntu I can upload " _ " buntu and wouldnt have to do some lenghty install like you would have to do with windows ? __eou__
yes __eou__
the ' p ' tells it to preserve permissions __eou__ that may only be technically be default for creating a tar and only necessary when extracting it like tar xvpf backup . tar or whatever ... not sure but wont hurt during the create __eou__
but as i said , it works fine under Mac OS __eou__
what do you mean ? __eou__
i guess people just don't want to have to reconfigure their entire PC again __eou__
I know , I defected from Windows 7 __eou__ Is there anything else I can help you with ? __eou__
I've never tried Vine on anything but Mac __eou__ i think it may be Mac only actually __eou__
I kind of figured that but it keeps telling me to fix it and I can't find the duplicate __eou__
ok , so what if I know all of the files end in a specific extension , and I only want to download new ones ? __eou__

Thanks __eou__

I'm afraid I'm not too familiar with your question . You might have already tried this , so I'm not sure if it'll help : **unknown** __eou__
ok __eou__
Yes __eou__
You want to access a shared folder ? __eou__
well , the order in which they load specifies the name __eou__ eth0 is the first card to load , eth1 is the second , and so on __eou__
Dude .. just stop worry about what I do . __eou__

shoulnt it be called **unknown** or some thing like that ? __eou__
why ? __eou__
good !! __eou__
I saw this mining thing the other day , no idea what it is __eou__ Some sort of distributed processing for money I guess ? __eou__
Right . And as far as I know mutter gets much more attention these days __eou__
:-D __eou__ prefix a ! to your command ( or better yet /msg ubottu with your query ) __eou__
i am not 100% sure what the + , - or ? is - i think its " on " " off " " unknown " __eou__ there is another command i just found - type in terminal " sudo ps -A " __eou__ im sorry PeterGriffin i do not know what it means __eou__
ofc __eou__
host-os loading is there anyways ... and a snapshot loads in a few seconds on a good enough computer to do anything 3d-related anyways ... __eou__
what is that ? __eou__
afaik they aren't removed on update , so they are no packages for them :/ __eou__
Then can I guess your issue is solved ? __eou__
hey , just installed that kernel module , beep is working now :) __eou__ that irritating noise is the speaker sound , I love that sound heheh __eou__

I have deleted sda3 , so now its sda1 , sda2 , unallocated __eou__
have you reviewed the help doc ? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router __eou__
yes but ip-tables is complicated . Thats why I chose to do it with shorewall , which in turn configures ip-tables . __eou__
should be synaptic you just have to know how to look . __eou__ aptitude is deprecated I would not use it __eou__
what 's your suggestion after that ? i do really new in setting up a IRC service :) __eou__
Does this report information about the module ? " modinfo usb_storage " . If it does , you ought to be able to do " sudo modprobe usb_storage " to load that module , which would then let the system recognise the USB storage __eou__ I've reinstalled Ubuntu in that same situation using what 's called a " chroot " but that does really require some expertise to know what to do with it __eou__
hehe easy mistake . ;) __eou__
Look for the entries that show the external monitor has been found , and whether it provides a valid EDID , and what modelines it claims to support , and finally , what mode the driver chose to use on that display ( and yes , pastebin it ) __eou__
sounds like a plan __eou__
ok :) __eou__
sure .. but then i have to deal with the whole keys business , blah blah __eou__
just random # 's to me . :) __eou__ could be its built into gnome , i dont see a speciifc ' vino ' command __eou__
i'm trying to find out which driver is in use . the **unknown** ... ones are of interest __eou__
dash ? how does the icon look like ? a white circle on black background ? __eou__ in this folder I have a list of applications with . desktop extension , is this normal ? __eou__
yeah __eou__
not sure what you mean ? __eou__
so the disk is trying to read something , something 's wrong with the hard disk that keeps it from being read , and it freezes ? __eou__
`chmod -R **unknown** , **unknown** ~/ . ssh` __eou__
i guess telling someone " hey , on this system you were trying to authenticate on anyone who already got local access can read this users ' authorized_keys " is a bit problematic , yes . __eou__
if that 's the only line in the output , `teamspeak` must not be running . __eou__ when you `ps aux | grep whatever` , there will always be a line in the output for the `grep whatever` __eou__ the ' 1564 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep -- **unknown** teamspeak ' line isn't for teamspeak itself , it 's for the command you used to see if teamspeak was running __eou__
get an up to date kernel . __eou__
that 's right . on **unknown** I try : ssh **unknown** but I'm still prompted for a password __eou__
so no quick config i guess ? __eou__
convinced me __eou__
yeah thanks __eou__
no im running a server __eou__ no gui __eou__ but sometimes i want to see what queries are being run when people hit my site __eou__
yes i will __eou__
Sounds like you mean you want to see the active connections on an apache2 web server __eou__
Good point .. wonder why mount says /run/shm instead . __eou__
I was kinda hoping you knew of some holy grail pdf application that I've been on this epic quest for , haha . Looking at Evince from google , isn't Ubuntu packaged with it __eou__ Oh no it 's already scanned , it 's a large pdf file with 702 pages that I burst with PDF Chain and now I'm individually editing them with gimp __eou__
do you have a live CD from which you can boot ? __eou__
yeah , it sounds like that might be the case . is there a way to fix that ? __eou__ well , lemme see if this kernel flag fixes the problem i started off tackling . then can go from there i guess . __eou__
It is doing a fresh install . __eou__
don't be silly , this channel is for support and that chatter is out of place here __eou__
i am able to use vpn on my phone with **unknown** but i am not sure about the ta . key __eou__

Installation finished . No error reported . __eou__

eventually you can use **unknown** c.d to disable them __eou__

thanks , will try that __eou__ Ok now the script looks like this : http://pastebin.com/HE1xUjyw and gives me the same results __eou__
i'm afraid i can't help , never installed on such hardware , but now that you explained the issue , others can help you . __eou__
the nohup solution works , thanks ! __eou__
Church- : got it working by switching a cable . switching back makes it fail again , so the cable 's probably busted . __eou__
I'm linux mint 13 __eou__
ok , I'll check when I get home for ssh configuration . Maybe I limited how many connections in a day or something ??? __eou__
so i wonder if it 's not the same type of issue __eou__
and **unknown** sure /dev/sda1 is the right partition ? and there is just this one partition which contains all of your linux installation ? __eou__ you may use the web chat at http://webchat.freenode.net __eou__
So , am I understanding correctly ... You created this encrypted partition using TrueCrypt on Windows ? __eou__ And secondly , did you configure this as a Hidden Volume ? __eou__
i woulld think it would work using the alternate installer . most likely not using the standard ubuntu installer / live cd __eou__
ok __eou__
You're welcome . __eou__
logged in on your mom 's account , do echo ' export LANG=es_ES . UTF-8 ' >> ~/ . bash __eou__

sorry i'm not any more help . :) __eou__
oh so i could try another ati driver your guess ? __eou__

the ubuntu installer comes with an option to encrypt your home directory but for whatever reason , it didn't encrypt my home directory this time . I want to encrypt the entire file system , including my hone directory ( im the only user) . I have other partitions on the HD that are windows so I dont think I can do a full disk encryption either __eou__
got any ideas ? __eou__
yea , got the unmount done but can't get new dvd to show up . rebooting . thanks __eou__
okay . jpeg sorry __eou__
thanks =) __eou__

In Ubuntu , the package is called " grub-efi ". Follow the command-line way as described in the ! recovergrub factoid , but apt-get install grub-efi first . __eou__ I'm not sure what can be the problem with live boot though __eou__ ( **unknown** was playing with ubottu , unfortunately she doesn't have a factoid on UEFI __eou__ Well , they use GRUB on LiveCDs , although it 's weird , since most people are able to live-boot on EFI __eou__

basically , I'd like to be able to drag/drop a folder or right click the folder , and hit extract , and it will search for all archives in that folder and extract them . ie a folder that has an entire season of a tv show __eou__
but we need to know what the MD5 is suppose to be ... __eou__
then i suggest you either invest some hours on reading up on what LVM is and how it works as an additional storage device layer , and look into how resiing file systems works manually . or , probably your better option since it will be faster and less error prone , make a backup and reinstall . __eou__
Is it a protocol as in secure ftp , or is it actually a ftp server ? __eou__
my suggestion was to uninstall those __eou__

http://pastebin.com/F48QyhGd __eou__
well- even on 32 bit linux flash can be a bit crappy . if that would make you feel better , it also fails quite alot under Waterfox ( 64 bit firefox on windows ) __eou__
i think in C , do you know where it is ? __eou__
yes it looks good __eou__
you DID hashcheck , right ? __eou__
it does if you suspect two specific directories __eou__
no __eou__ should i test the ram test at the ubuntu menu ? __eou__

im using the official ubuntu 64-bit iso from the ubuntu.com __eou__ 12.04 LTS __eou__
not icon view -- actual icons __eou__ the icons that DO display , unless they are previewable , look like a page with the corner turned down __eou__ i'd like folders to look like folders and files to not look like folder __eou__ it actually looks almost exactly like this screenshot , but happens even at boot : http://askubuntu.com/questions/115859/nautilus-icons-are-not-displayed __eou__
maybe a permissions issue if it ended up ownwed by root __eou__

okee , if i want to play a movie with VLC it sounds strange - with a back noice . I also have problems if i play a sound with mozilla as mailalert . i gues it is a comone plugin or something like that __eou__
Exactly what I was thinking , but how do i set that up ? __eou__
have you added them as mounted in my computer ? so you can just click on them and they are given a drive letter __eou__
hdd , fdd , lan __eou__
Will look into that __eou__

i only want to change the full name , not the login name __eou__
I dont ' it 's the '!', see : __eou__ there is an extra channel for that , read given link , you probably also don't want the ose-version from repos I guess , ah sorry , no but similar , there __eou__ look at their faqs , I'm off vmwaretools , but it 's same there and also fine documted in the FAQ / free tuts __eou__
how do I try backports , is there just a package to install ? __eou__
my question is really . how do i get my good old menus back . is it because i need to installed another windowmanager than the default one ? __eou__
what do you mean ? __eou__
nice to read ( **unknown** rather , it usually prompts if lvm2 isn't installed ) __eou__ mounted ?? you have to run it just on the UNmounted mapper ??!!! __eou__
It will not . :) __eou__

Have you ever booted from USB on this machine ? __eou__
and you followed that guide step by step in the url ? for putting it on your usb drive ? __eou__ the operating system would not affect boot order .. it is set by the bios __eou__ like we said that doesn't matter __eou__
Actually - it is current . :) __eou__
yeah , but then ifconfig hw ether ... should work if it were just mac address filtering , there are VERY few cards ( and they'd have to be very old ) that cant do that these days __eou__
seems to be doing the trick __eou__
why would startx do something different than booting with " quiet splash " set in /etc/default/grub ? __eou__ do they point to different instructions ? __eou__ you are right , sudo service lightdm start works . I can just set an alias to do this when I type startx . But I guess i'm just confused about the different chain of events between startx and lightdm start . lightdm start obviuosly starts an X server start also , are they just two different front ends to xinit ? __eou__
pae =p **unknown** , means a 32bit os can handle more than 4 g ram ( video .. ) total ... versions = development improvements ( mostly , hehe ) __eou__ virtual = extensions for quemu and such , realtime .. maybe read a bit on kernel.org or ask an question , nobody will be able to explain whole kernel-landscape __eou__

Thanks , didn't know . Will try right now ( it 's on the other computer) . brb __eou__ Ok , the " nomodeset " actually worked for me . Thanks so much . __eou__

this is not good news for me __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ I get the top bar down to **unknown** and then a huge white space . I also get their page links at the bottom . Just how content in between __eou__

just make sure to switch the view to classic winamp interface __eou__
thanks mate ! __eou__ I am trying out **unknown** , it 's a bit confusing . __eou__ test __eou__ can I ask a silly question . What sort of terminal clients do you guys use for IM'ing and IRC ? __eou__
// how is read speed for that drive ? __eou__ // it could either be because it 's ntfs , which runs slow on linux , or else because you don't have usb 3.0 support __eou__ // maybe because of ntfs . but there 's no safe way to test if you don't have some other partition on the drive __eou__
this has nothing to do with linux/ debian , as Unity is specific to Ubuntu ., however the shortcut to show the Desktop is Ctrl + Super + D ( Super is the left Windows key ) __eou__ http://askubuntu.com/questions/65971/what-is-the-show-desktop-keyboard-shortcut __eou__ I've just tested Ctrl + LeftWindows ( or Cmd key if you are using a Mac keyboard like me ) + D does work __eou__

netboot/netinstalls are handy __eou__

I don't know what your add ons are , take a look at what they do I guess , this may or may not be the problem . You suggest chrome does not work as well , check add ons there if you have any , we have to somewhat guess here . __eou__ Check with the IT department there . __eou__
should i still use . asoundrc ? that issue was with the mic , i don't have issues with , i have issues with a horrible sound quality . the thing about alsa not having controls working is minor , the worst is the quality __eou__
For your USB not-found-by-BIOS issue , there 's a couple of things you might check ( if you haven't already) . 1 . BIOS enabling USB devices ( usually in the chipset and related settings areas) , and 2 . Some ports aren't ( often the front ports ) aren't activated by the BIOS on some motherboards ... have you tried the USB in the rear motherboard USB ports when booting ? __eou__
allright , I'll stop :-) __eou__
" sudo " is an unrecognized command __eou__

Oh I just remembered that the s/w asked me what platforms it was for , preselected was something like " Linux + Windows " and I left that setting . __eou__

better/best means nothing as it is all subjective . I've used all . I chose what works best for me and my machine . That said , install one version and add the different desktop managers and try them all out . __eou__
i only want chat client for yahoo , gtalk and msn with webcam and voice for ubuntu ..... nothing more ..... __eou__
thats surprising ... i thought usb respone time is better then hdd __eou__
Or just simply have a CDRW that you can use/erase __eou__
well xfce and lxde have similar dependencies so the comparison would really be between them , unity(default ubuntu ) and kubuntu . personally i prefer kde or a ligher gtk environment like xfce or lxde __eou__
i know __eou__
i have it ... but i have not tried in on ubuntu ..... but then still if it works then it will only have google network and yahoo and msn networks will be left behind ..... so i want a chat lient which supports webcam and voice supporting yahoo , google and msn ...... nothing more ....... __eou__

I am guessing it must have wrote something to the internal SSD ( not user serviceable ) that the system just refuses to start from , that is about the only thing that is writeable __eou__ yes , I have tried that too __eou__ I suppose I will have to send an email to Samsung first , as there is no point in getting a third laptop and having the same thing happen again . heh __eou__
you could try it then , but Linux Mint with Cinnamon is not supported here . xD __eou__
Thanks it works , feel so stuipd , I knew about -f __eou__

then you are ok :) __eou__
Ah ok . I'm only dealing with FC SAN :) __eou__
" some day " but im quite sure that the old tablets ( as in the view of " some day " ) wont get support afterwards . so stick to the devs who made the ubuntu port __eou__
The openjdk is not developed for creating applications with Eclipse , isn't it ? __eou__
sure . Just don't ignore the security issues . __eou__
Thanks __eou__
as long as you understand that 12.10 is still being developed and meant for people who want to test and help with development at this point , then #ubuntu+1 can help you with the upgrade __eou__
ActionParsnip , Thanks will have a look __eou__
nope , i haven't added them . Shall i ? __eou__
it 's in the view menu somewhere IIRC __eou__
and what did u do ? __eou__
yep :) and they're working fast __eou__
cli always comes to the help :) __eou__
i can see the i/o errors from dmesg __eou__
You will be able to make it read-write-executable by chmod __eou__
if you have a script file you have made , just reference it in the rc . local file , you will need to mark the script executable with : chmod +x /path/to/scriptname __eou__ when you reference the script file , use the full pathname __eou__ how do you mean ? __eou__
THAT is the chip __eou__ run : echo " options iwl3945 11n_disable=1 " | sudo tee /etc/modprobe . **unknown** . conf > /dev/null __eou__ reboot to test __eou__ I assume the Driver= for the chip is the iwl3945 __eou__ those chips have issues with N speed , so the option makes it connect at G speed and is much more stable __eou__
its also LTS :) __eou__ Oneiric is supported til April 2013 not much support __eou__

kravion if you run : sudo lshw -C network what is the driver module you are using ? __eou__
you can see find 's -print options I guess . Or use basename with -exec . But if you want to do something with these names , then if you say what that something is , we can help you better __eou__ I mean -printf __eou__
Yes , so the libraries can be combined to that all-in-one program altogether . __eou__

I was trying to install Ubuntu but it didn ? t work until I changed the " OS Installer " ( or something like this ) option in the BIOS to " Others " instead of " Windows ". After Ubuntu was installed alongside Win7 I tried booting Win7 again but I got stuck at a black screen . Setting the Option back to " Windows " didn ? t solve the problem so I formatted my hard drive . Is there another way to somehow install Ubuntu alongside Win7 ? __eou__

That 's why . Ubuntu by default uses the discrete GPU and doesn't normally handle switching without some additional installation . __eou__ My laptop has about 2h of battery life on Ubuntu , but 7h on Windows because of that reason . The discrete GPU sucks a lot of power . __eou__ Depending on your card , you can try installing fglrx ( AMD 's proprietary driver ) and Catalyst Control Center and that MIGHT work . __eou__ Or you can try vga_switcheroo . Which may also work . __eou__ The " additional drivers " section in Ubuntu 's System Settings will allow you to install fglrx __eou__
read up on how getty works __eou__

..... means nothing , it 's just dots __eou__ depends , mostly if you kill it and re-spawn it it will be fine __eou__ are you using dhcp ? __eou__ you should be able to kill it and respawn it before it re-checks for a lease . __eou__
No , it isnt . async io is faster in almost all use cases . __eou__
thx :) __eou__
oops you're not him hahah __eou__
Its about 3.2 gb __eou__
thank you __eou__
I think you could , but you'd be in the realms of hash collision computing __eou__
so I've noticed ... You don't *have* to use the homedir for all users on just one drive . You can make a user account , just for logging into your machine , with a tiny homedir on your SSD , after having logged in , you can open up another session from within that terminal , using your main user credentials . __eou__
mhh ? two words ? __eou__
would you happen to know how much it would be a pita if one uses grub-efi over grub-pc to have working with refit ? __eou__ , **unknown** sorry :/ __eou__
split the files ... and its 5 gigs for free __eou__ and stuff like " he doesnt want to give me his adress on the phone " sounds REALLY ODD , doesnt it ? __eou__
gMTP fails and so mtp-detect __eou__
? __eou__ simple as in engineering , not as in ease of use is a common phrase __eou__
well there 's proprietary drivers that work with X , hopefully wayland has no proprietary parts __eou__
well I am behind multiple routers ... so I have to go and setup port forwarding .. pain in the ass __eou__

have a friend 's windows laptop that needs the mbr fixed , and it won't boot into anything but my ubuntu flash drive __eou__
now *that* is a good advice of Oerheks ^You can copy any settings you *want* at your leisure when logged into the new account . __eou__ if ou have screwed things up on a system-wide level , my more complex purge => reinstall will come in handy . __eou__
they changed it recently ? __eou__
what do I do than __eou__
is Ubuntu Unity customizable like that ? __eou__
Thanks again for the help , it works again . Had to find out how to make my system writable first , though . __eou__
it'll probably tell you *somewhere* __eou__ can you fiddle with the resolution settings in the control panel ? __eou__
BUT - unetbootin IS my solution ! try using dd or cat , to put the iso onto the usb perhaps ?!? __eou__

I look many changes in **unknown** __eou__ I try " echo 0 > **unknown** " and it is resolv problem with kworker :-) __eou__ What did I do ? :-) __eou__ I hurt you ? Sorry , I didn't understand why . __eou__
why ...? __eou__ here 's a question about win7 : http://superuser.com/questions/223560/how-to-create-a-windows-7-installation-usb-from-linux-or-mac __eou__
i guess so i can't even launch it . __eou__
try " sudo update-grub " and see if it get automatically added __eou__
you should be able to just right click on the jar and there should be a " Run with java 6 " or " Run with java 7 " option or something like that __eou__ or use java -jar from the command line __eou__
does somebody know why " allow-hotplug " support is removed in ubuntu ? (/etc/network/interfaces ) <- __eou__ its removed , no udev rules about that , etc __eou__
**unknown** , none of them work . zykotick9 downloaded videos and no video output at all if i use VLC __eou__
Then it is EXTREMELY unlikely __eou__ I guess that person might have tampered with your VM __eou__ gem is not an apt tool so apt-get will not uninstall it . I'm guessing sudo gem uninstall < thing > __eou__ open a terminal , type ping < url > __eou__
no . I've it and my sound works , also if i set it from alsamixer , but with the scrollbar of unity doesn't work . __eou__ Only " exclude audio " works on bar __eou__
can you pastebin . bash_aliases , . bashrc and maybe . bash_profile __eou__
googling and reading about it , not so much info specificly for 12.04 ; and i got no driver install experience __eou__ maybe https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Device/WG111T __eou__
yes __eou__
you need to add a few lines to . asoundrc ... w8 a sec and I'll upload mine ... __eou__ https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Set_the_default_sound_card < -- It 's for arch , but the same applies for linux __eou__ any linux-dist using alsa* __eou__
the directory exists __eou__ uh ... __eou__ well , i had /media/HDD set for **unknown** but then realized all my HDD 's are in the Media directory , so i just removed the HDD part and left it so my entire " /media " directory is shared .. now my server is running . __eou__ got me __eou__ no __eou__ well , with the hell ive been getting from ubuntu- i might move on pretty soon . __eou__ yea , thats why i came to them to begin with . but now they are acting like mandriva .. __eou__
if so , I will just take it to private chat- then no one can benefit . __eou__
maybe better you can post full output __eou__ install kubuntu-desktop __eou__ you know that __eou__
night , good luck __eou__
thank you , I didn't know it __eou__
this is NOT the jokes channel . __eou__
ahh , so gksudo will run the gui and elevate where needed and sudo will run entire application elevated ? __eou__
Ubuntu 12.10 is having a big problem with QT __eou__

nm , with nano you just exit and save __eou__ you go to quit " and then its like ' you want to save ' and you say ' yes , save it to grub '" __eou__
i'm no op , but i see you don't tend to be efficient , ( you confusing me man :) __eou__
you're not very informed about mint then . i'll join you in #ubuntu-offtopic if you'd like to chat about it . i think we're making the ops nervous here . __eou__
apt-cache policy output : **unknown** __eou__
must be there .. system/settings accessibility should be there somewhere __eou__ accessibility means people with physical problems -- ( not implying you are , but there may be something set to on) , there 's also system/setting keyboard ( shortcuts is 2nd tab ) __eou__
again - and what desktop-environment are you selecting in the boot-manager ? __eou__ or ' login session ' __eou__

what does top say ? __eou__
yes __eou__
I think I did install it on this session ( you mean no logoffs or restarts right ? ) __eou__
not xsession , " ~/ . xsession-errors " __eou__
what does nvidia-setings say the version is ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
ah ok , so 4GB it is :P __eou__ thx :) __eou__
maybe its a compiz thing , if yuo log in to the Unity2D session , is it ok ? __eou__ so its not a WM issue , if you make a new user and log in as that is it ok ? Log in twice to the session so that the blank configs can be created __eou__ pentium 3 isnt 64bit :) __eou__ do you have lo-menubar installed ? __eou__ thats probably going to be a step in the right direction __eou__
ive been dipping in and out __eou__ because the user can't control that __eou__ but reducing excessive and unecessary text helps the channel __eou__ its channel policy too , hence the factoid __eou__
thanks __eou__
except I get an invite __eou__
karmic is EOL , no support and no updates __eou__ just a newer release and you'll be fine __eou__ 12.04 is the latest stable as well as being LTS __eou__
It 's always a good idea to do backups though __eou__
except it 's a copy of the entire disk __eou__
if you buy me RAM i won't __eou__
I can't remember the name of the thing that does that , sorry . I haven't had my caffiene yet today though ;) __eou__
and i was just trying to point out that showing a problem in detailed works better then just asking for some general help in topic A __eou__
thanks ! __eou__ if /etc/init . **unknown** has # Default-Start : 2 3 4 5 . Will this go into effect on reboot ? __eou__
i wonder why the moved it up __eou__
I wil use foremost , but first I wanted to make an image of the drive with ddrescue and I am still not able to do it __eou__
hah ! :D Fair enough . The config for the file doesn't look too bad , but if I can't get it to work I might just do that __eou__ Figured it out . Use xrandr commands at openbox autostart to get everything configured properly __eou__
use the options to make it faster .... ignore errors . retry ince . and so on . the homepage has examples __eou__
lol dunno I thought I would say " ok " __eou__ Didn't work ! __eou__
probably , the other one that failed was also seagate __eou__ I know that ' now ' the hard way .. __eou__ But I really don't know if it 's failing as first I checked it with the Ashampoo program in Windows and it said that the hdd is ok .. __eou__ I really don't know what to buy next , but that 's another topic __eou__ good luck with math :) __eou__
I havent heard about it , so I dont think so __eou__
it doesn't look like it even has chkconfig __eou__
that just tells me what services are running , as opposed to what runlevels they are configured to run at on start __eou__
Perfect - thanks ! __eou__
i am testing lol , im a dj by proffesion and looking at diffrent laptop setups at the min , intrested in trying mixxx on ubuntu as windows is just greedy on resources __eou__
share the current desktop __eou__
because the partition you are working on needs to be unmounted __eou__
Newer releases don't use gconftool-2 now __eou__
can you try that " ls -n /mnt/var/lib/mysql/db1 " - i'm really curious now __eou__
i can ssh the machine .. but i need to view the desktop . __eou__
there might be . I would personally start by apt-get removing lubuntu-desktop , and then apt-get install lxde . if you can get that way if it is a package problem of some sort , you would know it is in the core of lxde . There is probably a better way to do this , but this is how I would do it . __eou__
can you run : cat /etc/lsb-release what is output please ? __eou__ cool __eou__ if you are using kernel 3.5 . 3 then you are using an unofficial kernel we cannot support here __eou__
cant hit google from here ... text only , and navigating via lynx is a pain ... __eou__
when I try to check my email it says I got the wrong password . __eou__ actually its a imap account and it is not able to connect to server , both . __eou__ man , I didn't have my imap at google set . Thank you anyways . __eou__
hmm , in xchat it could be the auto replace function . the problem here is , you may get this on other apps . but I would try for now to turn off auto replace in xchat , and see if that gets you anywhere , if it does , it 's not your keyboard layout . if it does not , that 's the direction i would be leaning to . __eou__ mee too ! :) __eou__ you can find the auto replace option in settings , i believe . I personally don't use xchat , but I will fire it up and look around too , __eou__
in other words , you are using xfce . me too . xubuntu is just a bunch of packages that make xfce prettier , and gives it some nice functionality . some very nice extras . __eou__
WILCO __eou__
no __eou__ you are not on 11.10 then ; 11.04 or prior __eou__
unfortunately , no . windows can not handle it , ubuntu is mounting it for 10-15 min , after that I can see the folders but I can not copy __eou__
just kidding __eou__
I tried with ddrescue , it is copying for 5 days and now I have not more than 1gb , the partition is around 40gb . __eou__ I mean it is really slow ... __eou__
gnome , not genome __eou__ I use Precise so I have GTK 3.4 . 2 __eou__
ok . thanks __eou__
: No , and I wget files on my LAN . Actually , even when I use wget with no arguments , I don't even have the help message ( thans for answering ) __eou__
have no clue , if nvidia-xconfig doesn't solve .. __eou__
i've tried that __eou__
thanks __eou__
wow perfect , thanks again . i was just about to ask how you found that :D __eou__
da si iztriq partitiona s windowsa i da si resizna diska __eou__
Great thanks __eou__
i read it and see that is only bug report for app __eou__
thanks __eou__
I am a huge fan of myth-tv But help and work on Ubuntu tv everyday it will be great maybe in Ubuntu 13.10 or Ubuntu 13.04 we will all know soon __eou__
# User privilege specification __eou__
I did not even know ubuntu had a kickstart implementation __eou__ no need to scrap your current one . Ignore me :-) __eou__
You're being dumb . Remove your name from the sudoers file . __eou__
and tk framework ? __eou__
actually , you have it backwards . The windows hosts file has the same meaning as the UNIX one . :) __eou__
it could be the sort of program that just runs on startup in the background , and you access it via your web-browser on http://localhost : <some port > or something __eou__
sudo cat $new >> /etc/hosts __eou__
most likely wrong , yes __eou__ do ps -ef | grep -i sick __eou__
the simplest benefit is probably just that your system is configured the way ubuntu expects , so it'll be easier to get support later . __eou__
okey , thank you I'll google " Unetbootin " to see what it is __eou__
- how do i setup the " NOPASSWD " option for sudo again ? __eou__
I dont understand why connecting to different network changes nameserver to localhost __eou__
thanks __eou__
then reboot or logout ? __eou__
It 's a command-line tool . If you want a GUI , install " gufw " from the software center . __eou__
thanks __eou__ I see that they say one option is -n or -- **unknown** . Can I just use -- **unknown** if I want to swipe over it 50 times ? __eou__
Put it wherever you want , just make sure it is a special subdirectory . __eou__
Hint : use " sudo -i " to get a root shell and then you can run commands as you normally would . It 's not really safe though ( you may erase something you don't want to , for instance ) __eou__
! fstab | layke __eou__ what filesystem is that partition anyway ? __eou__
I suspect doing stuff with compiz destroyed stuff __eou__
: in that case , ftp is fastest __eou__
were you using autoloogin previous to your lightdm crash ? __eou__
Yeah , but logging out a user is not something scripts normally do . __eou__
ok thanks Jordan_U __eou__ am back to : how do i d/l the development libraries for SDL/OpenGL ? __eou__
I want to put it into a script so that it logs out the user , instead of ending ther script . __eou__
" macs " is not a processor architecture , unless you're refering to the old ppc arch ( which interests me too though ) __eou__
I designed a webpage to work in Chrome , FF , IE and Opera , I did this in a windows vm , when I brought the files over to Ubuntu it looked really messed up in Chrome __eou__
Im not sure actually . It 's changed every release , and I can't quite figure this one out . Doesn't really seem to be in the repos that I can see __eou__
thanks :D __eou__ with a installation of ssh server you can get use scp , but can you doa sftp also ? __eou__
totally __eou__
google __eou__
I meant those in the menu , other than that look at the module parameters __eou__
weird .. yeah .. i mean it boots fine if i just change that one flag .. __eou__
it doesn't reuire dkms __eou__
no __eou__
non of my other servers have it in that style __eou__ kinda disorienbtating dealing with it __eou__
gdm ; Unrecognized service __eou__ no internet on that pc __eou__ As I mentioned before , I can't get it to connect __eou__
oh i didnt know that , how foobared __eou__ still alsa has to be in there __eou__
How do I do that ? __eou__ I anticipate I will have at least 50 GB of applications __eou__ so I don't know if that is a good setup __eou__
yay that seems to have worked . Thanks a lot :) __eou__
Any risk of anything else it might remove ? __eou__
do you happen to know a possible fix ? __eou__
I can't really do that because the entire drive is full __eou__ Is there a way to list all files above a certain filesize with ls or such ? __eou__
FWIW , you give the file a handle , then add even or odd to the handle in the cat command ( ex : pdftk **unknown** . pdf cat Aodd output **unknown** . pdf ) __eou__
after googling , i powered down , removed and inserted battery , and now it works . thanks for the **unknown** ) __eou__
so #gentoo is your channel __eou__
you need to figure out what is using the space ( something you should already " know " as well) . how much space is apt using for it 's cache ( " du -sh /var/cache/apt/archives/ " to find out) ? __eou__ suggestion , " cd / " then " du -sh * 2>/dev/null " to get the sizes of all your root directories ( might take a while ) __eou__
tutorial ? __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
which one are you referring to ? __eou__ ??? __eou__
this laptop came with a wierd cache raid __eou__
not sure __eou__
Juno would be ok , just no galileo , which is the one in the ubuntu repos __eou__
i was dual booting but i had screwed my grub\ however my files remain still \ had to reinstall xp to another poartition __eou__
no other reason than I want to . The problem is that it keeps logging back on . I think it is restarting based on my net connection , which is flacky __eou__
you mean you used the menu on your host system to do it ? Did you try to reinstall them , just run the installer again from terminal . __eou__ other than that I am really not sure what to do __eou__
that is disabling the account ... __eou__
omg , 12.04 , but I think this is an issue with unity __eou__
yes he is . __eou__
it 's already installed , it was working fine , but an hour ago i have to reboot ubuntu and then i got that message __eou__
ok , i'll try __eou__ i have enabled the 3D aceleration and 128MB for video but it stills show the message __eou__
ic __eou__
dlna/upnp servers can stream to a xbox360 __eou__
Eh , ok . I admit defeat . :/ __eou__ Thanks for the help . __eou__

arg . Yep that 's it . Thank you . Was just trying to follow the java install guide . Says to start with a % . silly me __eou__
ya right .. you do as well __eou__ its been almost .. but nothing seems to float __eou__
isnt it the package " firmware-b43-installer " which contains the driver ? __eou__
i cant understand the " Under the desktop menu System > Administration > Hardware/Additional Drivers , the STA drivers can be activated for use . " because i have a stock lxde installation __eou__
after you install that package , you will see the device appear in the additional drivers utiility __eou__
I've been using **unknown** ( that 's it 's name ) __eou__
you're welcome __eou__
I don't have experience with cryptsetup but from google it looks like it only encrypts the drive with no option to make it bootable . So to use that external drive you need an OS that has cryptsetup installed to be prompted for password to open the drive . __eou__ what OS is on the external HD ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
i changed from internal audio analog stereo to GF104 HDMI __eou__
fde ? __eou__
and ofcource which one is that ? sorry i am asking cause i have no clue . i just want to activate my wireless __eou__
oh , I don't care , do it if you really want to . I advise against it , but it 's up to you __eou__
Thanks , I'll try that __eou__
i had ubuntu booting from a jump drive __eou__
i just need someone to point me in the right direction because the first link you showed me is broken __eou__
Yep . They still see your IP in the swarm . __eou__ All peerguardian and peerblock do is consult a whitelist of people you won't share with . __eou__ Err . blacklist . __eou__ So theoretically , you won't be sharing to the blocked IPs , and thus if you're involved in illicit downloads MIGHT not be **unknown** . __eou__ But it doesn't, and cannot hide your IP from the swarm . __eou__
it doesnt help __eou__
? __eou__ left over interface ? __eou__ you're getting problems when trying to scan wlan0 ? __eou__
install from soft center __eou__
quote marks around the package name or , as HG suggested , change __eou__ please restate the problem you're having __eou__
per wiki Unity is a shell interface for the GNOME desktop environment developed by Canonical Ltd for its Ubuntu operating system . __eou__ so unity is interface ( look ) thats running on top of GNOME ... so if your interested you may figure out how to replace it __eou__
you mean irc ? __eou__
how can i add the current user to sudo __eou__
sorry . I'm in China . Can't see your link __eou__ ty __eou__
i know this lol __eou__ but this doesnt help me __eou__ i run a chroot image and its somehow setup to autologin , only autologin is disabled ... __eou__ so i cannot choose a session when logging out __eou__
yes __eou__ its basiclly a base install of ubuntu ( no GUI , pre-install software , etc . ) __eou__ and i like it :D __eou__
ty __eou__
i know , so i wanna get rid of unity , and use LXDE __eou__
ty __eou__
If by outside you mean ssh or something , then no . I'm physically on this coputer . I fig that one out too though ( about why I had to use sudo) . Seems to me there is something funny going on with using my system though . I'd swear that after using chown and chmod to set a directory to my user then reboot it sets it back to root and whatever perms they were before . __eou__
cell : oops __eou__ ! encrypt | Cell __eou__
it 's cool . I'm not gonna rack my brain over it . You helped me though . For years I've used synaptic to located files and I could have been using the package site the entire time . __eou__
well unity , gnome does like to use over 700MB it seems , maybe more RAM needed __eou__ then just installing lxde and choosing it at login would help still instead of reinstalling __eou__
rmdir __eou__
a network with modem -- powerline adapter -- linksys wifi got problems connecting to ssh __eou__
this might work >>> http://cgiproxy.at/ __eou__
try installing flash or ubuntu-restricted-extras __eou__
maybe i just need the hp usb format tool . everytime i installed with unetbootin my usb would boot to purple ubuntu screen with only default as option __eou__
indeed __eou__ but sometimes you've got to just tie that chainbrake back and take the kevlar gloves off ... __eou__
which version of your ubuntu server __eou__
if you're installing a server , use an LTS __eou__ is the wireless connection the main connection for the server ? Because that 's a really bad idea __eou__ okay , well as long as you're not expecting more than a couple of simultaneous connections , it might work __eou__
right , but what are you actually trying to do with this directory ? Copy it from one machine to another ? __eou__
weird __eou__ synaptics is pretty weird and buggy __eou__
even if you confirm bugs or give good examples of how to trigger them __eou__ simply saying " there 's a bug " isn't actually that helpful __eou__ what 's *really* helpful is if people can find bugs in the bug tracker and see if they work __eou__
sda5 is showing as a unknown file type , it isn't mounting at the least , the script is empty of any info on grub consequently . __eou__ I think you might make a thread on the ubuntu forums , it look pretty broken from here . __eou__
can you maybe find the package in the Synaptic Package Manager ? __eou__
you won't be able to access any dns that the named process on your machine is serving __eou__
how to ? __eou__
yep . Just run ' top ' __eou__ it'll give you a list of running processes . __eou__ sounds more like what you're looking for rather than services . __eou__
lightdm is not running .. there is a window on Ctrl+Alt+F8 stating " system is running in low graphics mode ". But I don't know how to kill it . __eou__
Well I am thinking of getting another printer , but it will just be for office use and well the Epson is just sting in a dusty corner __eou__ Will do , thank you :D __eou__ Do you know if this printer will work well on linux ? http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Multifunctionals/Inkjet/PIXMA_MG2140/ __eou__
the 96 driver works with old nvidia chips __eou__ if you REALLY want the driver , run the file in root recovery mode __eou__
shift isn't it ? __eou__
well then i guess that ubuntu just don't have the driver ... parted magic is better in this way __eou__
but the syntax of the command is already there for you , the history of bread when buying bread is completely different __eou__ you aren't after the history of SSH , that would be comparable __eou__
when you are selecting the os before loading it - press **unknown** options ) - there will be nomodeset option __eou__ if it isn't there - you can manualy edit the os line by pressing " e " - and add nomodeset __eou__ it helped me with geforce 550 ti __eou__
ok __eou__
try it and see you may need to use -a or . * type wildcards . may be worth the time to check a few bash tutorials for examples __eou__
Can you find the process by command ' ps -ef |grep X ' ? __eou__
where in the process ? __eou__
you did a wubi install ' **unknown** ' windows ? ewwww __eou__
i used chsh command to run bash instead of sh . its working fine now __eou__
Actually it automatically came when I done complete hard disk installation using ubuntu __eou__ is it possible to recover data from one partition ? __eou__
thanks a lot , appreciate it ! __eou__
thank you :D __eou__
Maverick is my second favourite release , after 6.06 __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
I have jdk 1.7 . 0 installed and followed this instructions : **unknown** __eou__
what is ? and who ? and trying what ? __eou__
yes , but it doesn't browse both directory file structures using one panel __eou__
I would use a different port , but you shouldn't /have/ to do that . Definitely sounds like an mpd specific problem rather than an ubuntu specific problem though . __eou__ There 's probably an #mpd channel that can better help you __eou__
ok . next thought : did you allow ubuntu to automatically partition or did you manually do it ? __eou__
their website does not give binaries - only source __eou__
after defaults ? __eou__
sorry , misreafd __eou__

You need read and write permission to the device , so typically one runs fsck as root . sudo fsck /dev/sda1 __eou__ But DO NOT run it on a filesystem that is mounted __eou__
try something like " sudo mkdir /tmp && sudo chmod 1777 /tmp && sudo chown root . root /tmp " __eou__ that 's off the top of my head ; I could be wrong but it shouldn't make anything *worse* ... __eou__
" is it better " or " will it get better " well , yes , and yes , but better is subjective so ... __eou__ If you are happy with 11.10 , stay .... __eou__ But LTS is a good place to be , ( IMHO) . __eou__

So you installed it as a windows app ( the Wubi installer ? ) __eou__ for dual booting you would pick that option during the Ubuntu installation ( the advanced partitioning stuff ) and create an ext4 ( or 3 ) partition for Ubuntu , and a partition for the swap ( ext2 ) __eou__ If Windows currently takes the entire drive , then you may need to shrink that partition , which can take a while __eou__ oh , so you're not using the Wubi installer __eou__
you would really fsck for a large file moved onto the disk from an hfs+ drive ? I would expect the file to have problems , but not the filesystem . __eou__

you don't need to overwrite the windows mbr on sda , you can use sdb __eou__ if you installed grub to sdb , then you just need to set in bios to boot from that hdd first __eou__

Truecrypt has a non-Free ( and pretty poor ) license , and is a pain to install in a *reliable and secure* dual boot fashion . You can use manual partitioning in Ubuntu 's installer and it will give you the option to install grub to the PBR of your ext4 partition , but this is unreliable and insecure ( with any bootloader) . You can also install grub to the MBR and reliably load Truecrypt from grub , but I unfortunately don __eou__ ... don't have time to explain how to do that at the moment . __eou__

how do I do it ? __eou__
np , thanks for the heads up __eou__
thanks , also I am going to be dula booting windows 8 and ubuntu on this machine so this won't erase my windows 8 stuff and other partitions will it ? Just so that I don't get screemed at with insults I would like to clarify I do not like windows but I need it to run software that doesnt work in wine . __eou__
: i want to know how much partition i can do ? __eou__
you are welcome __eou__
Cool you need to be aware of the types of partitions and the limit to the amount allowed on a single HD . __eou__
manage to get it working on the low graphics mode , thanks __eou__
then change the boot flag to the new partion __eou__
will try that in a second , gotta install ( had uninstalled it for space reasons ) __eou__
I see __eou__
you on the cd or in the install you are saying both here . __eou__
That 's entirely weird ... I can see a file called " test . sql " here just fine __eou__

shoot , I'm sorry but I haven't had an Intel machine behave poorly for a while __eou__ and I've run all three chipsets in the last few years , so I've had to learn AMD , Nvidia , and Intel quirks .. needless to say it gets lost at some point . __eou__ You may be left at googling from here if somebody else can't chime in . __eou__
Nowhere -- if you're trying to use something that 's not officially supported by Ubuntu , you're on your own . Might ask in #ubuntu-offtopic but idk how much help will that be . __eou__ Might ask in #backtrack-linux too __eou__
**unknown** : can you tell us whats the purpose for that ? __eou__ you could make your own startup icons with commands , sudo in front __eou__
Are you in the directory where the file " psybnc " is located ? __eou__ And which permissions does that file have currently ? __eou__ Then provide the exact , detailed error message . __eou__ Whats the output of ls -lha on that file . __eou__
Last I checked , the repo was at an older version __eou__ dunno about that . __eou__ you want to load some sort of logitech . conf that affects anything that uses the webcam during a session ? Sorry , don't know of that __eou__ normally that is the instructions on how to install , not an executable __eou__
I think it 's " safe " in that I don't expect it to cause any data loss or breakage which can't be fixed by booting into an older kernel , but it may not be stable . __eou__
yep , done that nothing happens __eou__
i'm so lazy today __eou__
Hm , okay then ... Not sure . __eou__
regarding your question : ' apt ' is the basic cmd to update packages from cli __eou__
how on earth is this any more convenient than a single install file executable ? __eou__
The standard way to compile is . /configure ; make if you want to install that to the system do make install but i'm not sure how make install function __eou__
perhaps ( I don't know , though ) the problem is that I stopped updating my Ubuntu a long ago . And , therefore , my PC is not " synchronized " with what they have now . Could it be something like that ? __eou__
sorry . I know . __eou__
it works okay ? you havent had any issues ? __eou__
it seems to be down every time I need it :( __eou__
No , before i had C and D partitions . In C partition i always keep OS'es and system soft and etc .. In D partition i am storing al my personal data files . So now i need to delete C partition and prepare it for Ubuntu . Am i right or no ? :? __eou__
what is apt ??? sorry this is my first day in ubuntu __eou__

chmod +x foo . run then . /foo . run but what are you running ? __eou__ the version in the repos dosent work ? __eou__

my memory is rusty on that version , it is possible that they weren't using upstart at that point . __eou__ try " pidof sshd " __eou__ you could also try " dpkg -- get-selections | grep openssh-server " to see if its even installed __eou__
is there at least a way to manage the unity features ? like resising it ? __eou__
how do I make sure sshd is running ? __eou__
np __eou__
It 's okay , it all leads back to Debian eventually lol __eou__
do I need to install service ? __eou__
Uninstall xorg __eou__
which command sorry ? __eou__ aptitude ? __eou__
I want to migrate my install from wubi to be a dual boot . When I installed it I choose a small , partition , around 30GB . I am following these instructions : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi I see sda4 matches that size , but has mount point as ' /host ' __eou__
Yes , you need to boot from liveCD and shrink one or more partitions in order to make at least 30G free space . ( I recommend more , much more . ) __eou__ Now I am not an authority on migraging wubi . Like I said , I've never done it . But I do know how to re-partition and make room for a Linux install , so ... __eou__
thanks __eou__

latest precise kernel is 3.2 . 0.30 you may want to run updates : sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade __eou__

I triggered the bot , because you are over using your enter key . __eou__
I d do that but I ran out of blanks when I did that with the server iso :P __eou__

no , although you could start by installing a minimum distro __eou__
do you have a link for that guide ? __eou__ I don't see any tutorials __eou__
yes it is __eou__

thanks :) one last help ? drive gets mounted to **unknown** . so I should change the ownership of this **unknown** . folder or I should set a permanent mount point and change its ownership __eou__
well atleast that tells you where the culprit lies . I never have the money for new hardware , so i am always in luck there . sorry i couldnt be more helpful ... :) __eou__
sorry , i wish i could help you in vmware . i know it 's an excellent virtualization platform . I just have no experience with it . __eou__
np . Might not be the best solution , but it 's a workaround __eou__
you're right not related to Ubuntu __eou__
what you mean ? __eou__
/join #compiz __eou__
i doubt most users inhere do use qmail - you might have more luck in the server channels __eou__
though that 's a cloud image and doesn't have things like Kubuntu builds . I'll yield the floor for **unknown** 's issue however . __eou__
I always do it manually too , separate /home partition ftw __eou__
That vertical bar on the left is not GNOME3 , it 's actually the launcher for the " Unity " shell . You can try GNOME3 's default shell , gnome-shell , but my guess is that you'll probably be happiest with XFCE which is very similar to GNOME2 , and will stay that way for the foreseeable future ( so you get what you like , without having to use old software) . __eou__ Xubuntu is a flavor of Ubuntu which uses the XFCE desktop by default . __eou__
fstab will work for everyone ! __eou__
ok then you can just add entries in /etc/fstab to mount them there ... the various columns will allow you to add the needed options __eou__ because ? __eou__ that shouldn't be a problem =) __eou__ yes don't worry about that =) its not like windows running out of drive letters __eou__ btw i was gong to explain , if somebodys directory is **unknown** , then you can use -o uid -o gid -o mode etc . to set the apparent permissions on DOS fat portitions mounted __eou__
What has the windows loader to do with my problem ? __eou__
yes , and 12.04 . 1 ppc is missing . and thats contradictory to the FAQ you pointed me at . __eou__ looking at the . list files those amd64+mac disks do not contain . powerpc . deb packages __eou__
I'm pretty clueless when it comes to this stuff :) but I mostly use my computer for latex and some programming so linux is easier to work with than anything else still __eou__
like xinit ? __eou__
applications accessories terminal ? __eou__
i had a 486 with MFM and SCSI disks =) and 16mb ram in 16* 1mb 30pin simms =) __eou__ used to boot dos off a 30mb or so 625/4/17 MFM CHS disk ( you know on the old ST412/506 interface cables ) on a WD1003 traditional AT disk controller ... and then LOADLIN linux that mounted root from a scsi or pata drive ( pata channel being on a sound card which was initialiazed by a dos program ) __eou__
how goes the install ? __eou__
Will that search all sub directories too though ? __eou__
I am member of Launchpad __eou__
??? __eou__
stay on topic . lets move on __eou__
ah , though s/he said she/he was earlier ... __eou__
ah , okay ;-) __eou__
you are missing a disk __eou__ no , they are not __eou__ grub has nothing to do with if your OS can see a disk or not __eou__
you mean i have to link it on the server in a static routes __eou__
aaat take motherboard out , unplug speakers etc .. yah i know =) __eou__ still it could just be that fixing that will properly fix it the hwclock may not register properly at all __eou__ when running , check ' dmesg ' for warnings __eou__ it may SAY that it has found error and marked filessytem dirty __eou__ this would be helpful to know if that is actually happening , or not __eou__ you get used to reading it and whats normal __eou__ the most useful think todo is firstly dmesg and then look again later and see what ' new ' messages have appeared __eou__ i suspect ' e4 ' or ' ext4 ' may be part of the line you need to see but not sure __eou__ there should be something about filesystem dirty or error on device or whatever , it will give you clues if that is actually happening __eou__ besides which you might want to see erros about the block device , not an ext4fs error __eou__ ' dmesg ' tells you what the kernel has to say for itself , read it all , look at it , learn think , ask questions __eou__
I tried several . Thanks . I'll try that . __eou__ Hey , I don't actually know where to put this init =/ bin/bash line . My grub . cfg doesn't have a `kernel ' line in anything __eou__
nope , no such file __eou__
oh , sorry , I figured it was broken , didn't read from the start __eou__
solved , it was because the tutorial was for ubuntu 11 ( not unity ) __eou__ instead i need to use this command : gconftool -- set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/devices_option -- **unknown** 0 __eou__ thanks __eou__
I need to ask is , is it okay for my system to remove all the reserved space from other partition ? __eou__
do you use compiz ? __eou__ i think becaouse of compiz you can't uncheck the box __eou__ if fullscreen doesn't work - just disable compiz for a moment __eou__ log out and choose other options like ubuntu classic or unity __eou__
error message http://paste.ubuntu.com/1202432/ __eou__
yes was lowercase , its RT2870 Ralink USB __eou__
and ideally you would read the script and make sure it 's not malicious __eou__
without that __eou__
sorry __eou__
I think you mean I should do port forwarding in my router , is that right ? __eou__

Yeah , that would make sense , except for the massive-ass external psu I have to connect it to :/ __eou__
Ok , I don't know then . Sometimes I can even successfully make persistent settings as my normal user . I don't understand why they keep sometimes but not others . __eou__

I tried reaching Muon though the Alt+f2 box . __eou__ I'm not sure how to role back the update . __eou__ ps -e | grep muon shows nothing __eou__ As in , I can't find them . They're not in the menu anymore . I tried reaching Muon though the Alt+f2 box . __eou__
yea , there 's a standard http_proxy env var that is just ignored in the debian package that downloads the tarball __eou__

all __eou__
intel __eou__
I see ... thanks ! __eou__
I am experiencing the java plugin missing altogether . __eou__
have you tried the nm-connection-editor command __eou__ the nm-connection-editor command opens the Network-Manager . use it to add your device to the Network . I think that'll work __eou__
virtualenv is an ubuntu package __eou__ do you have any ideas to solve the problem ? __eou__
oh you had that issue before ? as i kinda expected i can find the exact lines in the logs :/ __eou__ i didn't expect press S to continue being logged ... __eou__ only thing i remember ... __eou__
checkinstall isn't quite what I'm looking for but looks like something that 's nice to know about . __eou__
This is a Ubuntu support channel . __eou__
as I said , it depends on how much ram you got ... __eou__
! 12.10 | **unknown** __eou__
so how would I check if I'm using the manuf driver or not ? I attempted to install the manuf drivers to fix some issues I was having , but it didn't seem to help , so I want to know if the problems are occuring in spite of the manuf drivers or if they didn't install right __eou__
I think more debian as ubuntu is ? __eou__
it 's a pcap file __eou__
Then just update to 12.04 and you will get the " latest " stuff . __eou__
apt-get update , apt-get upgrade *cancel* , read list , sudo apt-get install < packages > __eou__

ill figure out a way to get the iso on the disk , but i still need to get it to install without hanging in vmware player __eou__ i am not at a clients house __eou__
another option is apt-get install -t $release package where $release is your desired series . __eou__
I would just do a gksudo naultilus search for anything named libreoffice and it probably did you use purge to remove these originally ? __eou__
Well , then just install openoffice , when you need it :) __eou__
trivial to try ... __eou__
Not sure really then . __eou__
I see . I'll try that then . what commands am I looking for to do this ? __eou__
The extended does not show up in GParted , just Disk utility . __eou__
nothing says md .. __eou__
yepp , this is exactly what I am doing . one Vm for libreoffice ( pre-installed ) and one VM for Open Office __eou__
does it have to be aware of both monitors ? Could I just set the resolution to 1280x800 and have it display the same on both screens ? __eou__
I know :P __eou__
Then dmesg or syslog should tell you . Also " mount ", " blkid ", " fdisk -l " ... __eou__
thought that factoid might have new info , but not really __eou__
Nancy Grace is not trying to troll . I , Nancy Grace , need to get my Microsoft Office ( TM ) installed on my Ubuntu ( TM ) machine . __eou__

thanks let me check by rebooting ... __eou__ plymount installed fine , but it only shows on shutdown but not on boot up ... __eou__
? __eou__ No , there is no backport of 10.04 - maybe there is a PPA for a 3.2 . 6 kernel for 10.04 __eou__ Then try the mainline kernel ppa __eou__
Yes , you type " history " and press Enter __eou__

boot will go to the mbr . __eou__ YOu want to do a manual something other install make sure grub is pointed at the usb like sdb etc whatever it is no partitions for grub . __eou__ The swap normally is equal to the ram if you want to hibernate , what is your ram and do you need a hibernate ? __eou__
ah __eou__
Are you sure that computer has enough you need a gig of ram at the least and the kernels are pae , I don't think it will run on that unit . __eou__
what do you mean ? VB ? __eou__
Before today I did not knew about the use of it . __eou__ but now I am amazed ! __eou__
to the Main server __eou__
much much appreciated __eou__
no *official* support __eou__
I remember using lirc , but I don't remember what I did :( __eou__
then change it and contribute to society .. stop complaining . xD __eou__ Thank you for the information . Your job of notifying the Ubuntu community is complete . __eou__
fire fox __eou__
there 's literally no reason that apt-get update shouldn't update the kernel __eou__
i never use it though found this morning only __eou__
means mount and all stuff __eou__
well , haven't minded over it , right ? __eou__
yum __eou__
thanks that worked ! __eou__ just kidding I have no idea what I'm doing . what command do I run ? __eou__
Thanks . **unknown** : That was the issue - working now , thank you very much :) __eou__
no , i minimize the browser then open up the command prompt and i can see the flash video in the terminal o.O __eou__
you're right , I found a video which allows to use the html5 player , and it 's working fine __eou__
When I open it , it immediately " hangs ", and when I try to quit by clicking the " x ", it says it is not responding and asks if I desire to " force quit " __eou__ by " hangs ", I mean I cannot navigate around the user interface of the program such as move from one email to another , or even open the menus __eou__
nothing there because you havn't put anything there ... defaults and so on ... __eou__
I'm guessing you're using unity ? then I have no idea :/ __eou__ try this in a terminal : metacity -- replace __eou__ I'd goto http://wiki.ubuntu.org and http://help.ubuntu.org and pay good attention at the Beginners-section :) __eou__ how can xfce be laggy and unity not ? ... that is physically impossible ... __eou__ bad configuration then ... or just not installed the correct nvidia-driver :) __eou__ then there 's your problem ... you need to install the nvidia-driver :) __eou__
don't know what xfce would be choppy and laggy , ubless you've got hw problems . it 's got no eye candy extras really __eou__
just the one tho ? ugh __eou__ now I have a symbolic link warning and don't know what to do ... 4 options :( __eou__
ok , thanks for the help , I'll have to see if I cna get a usb or pcmcia card __eou__
sudo apt-get purge thunderbird then reinstall __eou__
how did you fix it ? __eou__
I said " s**** this , I'm moving to KDE ..." and then " s**** this , I'm moving to Arch " ^^ __eou__
ok let me try it __eou__
I looked in an Ubuntu forum and found this : __eou__
is it possible to create an array ( using mdadm or whatever ) without obliterating the data already on the drives ? __eou__
thank you __eou__
that 's really unfortunate , i'm sorry to hear that didn't work automatically . you'll have to install the drivers , are you able to find them ? __eou__
May I PM you ? __eou__
yeah and where is that ? :P __eou__
what we fixed it with was eventually a whole new PC with different graphics card , etc . __eou__ for me , however , the dual-monitor freezing went away after several weeks of ubuntu updates __eou__
you mean the magazine ? __eou__
does sudo iwlist wlan0 scan shows the available access points including the one to want to connect to ? __eou__ I looked in an Ubuntu forum and found this : __eou__ does iwlist works or not ? command not found sounds like if it was not installed __eou__
i never learned anything about lua . should i ? __eou__
haha i know :D __eou__
yes , that 's the problem . 1024MB perhaps ? __eou__
how much of coding do you know on linux ? __eou__
nothing __eou__
just hanging i do not get the promp back gotta crl C it __eou__
tried to uninstall the package you were trying to install ? __eou__ sudo apt-get remove -- purge man-db __eou__ it 's getting stuck at that point __eou__
let us hope soo . I hate multimedia taking too long to load up :P __eou__
is there any way that i can just read the disk with some sort of livecd , like knoppix ? __eou__ i just need to copy some files __eou__
no results __eou__ no that gives me : http://bpaste.net/show/52q4AYLP288zruBq2lpc/ __eou__
do pvs __eou__ type pvs , and it will show the groupname the LVM belongs 2 and mount it by the group __eou__
i see the drive with fdisk -l (/dev/sdc1 system GPT ) but i dont see the filesystem it is __eou__
will do , you do the same :) __eou__
sudo apt-get install man-db ? __eou__
without knowing what was deleted or changed reinstall is the quickest option . __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
I have that hw ! ^^ __eou__
no , that was archlinux __eou__
doesn't have that . Using Honeycomb android 3.1 __eou__
unless you have it to open up ports and backdoors , nothing :) __eou__
buhman : i'm not exactly sure what belongs in this new asound . conf file i had to create . __eou__
if it doesn't work you're doing it wrong __eou__ it is unlikely you have hardware that is completely unsupported and/or are encountering a legitimate alsa bug . __eou__ ( with the exception of those winmodem sound card pieces of crap from 1997 ) __eou__ ( but nobody has that hardware anymore ) __eou__
their wiki is god-like : 3 __eou__
ok thank you very much sir . You are a gentleman and a scholar ! __eou__
what could be the matter with my clipboard ? __eou__
well if you are to recover you data , you will need a drive that is as big as all the data you wan to recover ( either connected to that machine or to a networked computer ) __eou__ and stop using that drive immediately . make a bootable USB that has a live linux on it so you dont write anything more to that disk __eou__
close all program that might be using the card before trying to remove the modules __eou__
check it again ;) __eou__ If it says " no signal " then it finds the card ... __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
thanks __eou__
There isn't any such icon on the screen . It is the " Installation Type " screen . It has options to create new partition table , add , change , delete , revert , as well as boot loader installation choice . But none of the new/add/change buttons work __eou__
Best thing is to use git from the official repos . __eou__
then i think we found the problem :) __eou__
cute_bettong : maybe kernel msges about audio card __eou__ cute_bettong :d id you take a look in ' additional drivers ' if your audio card got an alternate driver ? __eou__
it should be easy trying a different login manager , you can add another , and set it as default __eou__
I was just feeling I could do it . ;) I was wrong __eou__
no date given ? __eou__
install on fat16 USB __eou__ primary->noname-fat16 / primary->casper-rw -ext2 .... __eou__
pulse will always try to open devices automatically as far as I know __eou__ could be it tried opening the real card first , and then trying " others " __eou__
try to fix ur software with update on usb in service mode ? __eou__
Do you have the kernel module loaded , for your speaker ? __eou__
sudo chown -R yourusername /var/www/ __eou__
I assumed you had recursively chowned all of /etc . If that 's not the case ( you just chowned /etc itself) , then you should be good __eou__ nope , not all things have root : ownership __eou__ yes , but like I said , not all files in your /etc may be owned by root ... __eou__
since udev is root , and my script should run as the logged in user __eou__ I guess I just call nmci from A , that would work __eou__
I googled 5 minutes and then gave up __eou__
yea idk .. i cant see any of the themes i've installed .. __eou__
welcome , though some debug/stderr might disturb your terminal __eou__
i know now what was the problem , i missunderstood one instruction __eou__
^ __eou__ put the mount point in front of / __eou__ lest you are mounting the ntfs drive as root :P __eou__
i dunno , it depends which desktop you're using __eou__
has been for ages . __eou__ worked fine for the last 3+ years i belive __eou__
don't we have a botentry for fstab ? esing can definitely use some ! fstab __eou__
no problem __eou__
am in text only mode at the moment __eou__ am attempting to do this : http://askubuntu.com/questions/87040/how-to-install-mate __eou__
I recognise that , hence why I'm trying to get an opinion front he community before jumping in ; ) __eou__
i hear ya __eou__ i do use a seperate home partition , so this way i will be able to restore my de and app settings with a copy/paste from my mint home folder :) __eou__
no , it 's fully native , it 's just that instead of running from a partition , it runs from a file __eou__ the system fully boots into Ubuntu , just from a file located on the windows filesystem __eou__
My software center does not find AVAST __eou__
i hope you know what youre talking about . [ x ] got this freebsd shell , he wants to run . exe in that shell __eou__ and ssh windows ? hopefully its rdp youre talking about __eou__
Cheers , but I can just move the sound file and replace the default start up sound file right ? __eou__
Direct USB . __eou__
Not sure , if clamAV is sufficient I'd not need Avast __eou__ I want to check my Windows 7 parition with Ubuntu __eou__
I haven't given up . I've just posponed .. LOL ! I'll get back to you on that one ., __eou__
and /etc/network/interfaces was typically for server network configuration __eou__
yes , better than synaptic :) http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/projects/aptitude/doc/en/ch02s03s05.html __eou__
yes now i get what is foo and what is bar __eou__ yes and also i have to remove first 2 characters __eou__
like this ? sudo apt-add-repository ppa : **unknown** __eou__
isn't there an " out of the box " solution ? __eou__
Makes sense . Thanks man . __eou__
maybe better for server edition on it __eou__
its not gnome-terminal __eou__
if you want to see the case http://imagebin.org/228520 __eou__ 1ghz __eou__
installing a virtual machine software on your desktop , start that vm-software and define 2 virtual **unknown** . install any os you want in those vms - set the network up for all vm 's and there you go . virtualbox or vmware are known **unknown** . no need for having extra hardware powered up 24x7 __eou__
i got it installed using dpkg in terminal __eou__
i thought i did __eou__ ty thought __eou__ I'm just reading about changing all to uuid , grub 1 was way esier in coniguring __eou__
it seems like the ssh server isn't responding - or refusing the connection . check the config and make sure it 's listening on the right interface __eou__
**unknown** ON UBUNTU __eou__ in debian it works just fine __eou__
is there anyway to get rid of the message ? __eou__
it is just before I logged in __eou__ it is after I choose windows or ubuntu to start , and before I logged in __eou__
: I left to choose the burning speed by software . And the image was already burned to another CD and ran . __eou__
picard is the app that runs musicbrainz but it is a gui version __eou__
Ctrl+Alt+T __eou__
yes , it is a gui app as far as I know __eou__
pkill -KILL -u < username > __eou__ i remember reading something about it ... mesh networking i think it is __eou__
I'll try . It goes away so quick that barely can read it with my bad English . I'll come back in other moment with the complete message . :) __eou__
is that the ubuntu launchpad ? __eou__
I thought it is only for the ' input file'. Thanks , it is written that it would destroy the data in output device . Also it is for ddrescue , do you think it will apply to gddrescue also ? __eou__ sorry , my mistake for the gddrescue I wrote , thanks , I will take a look at it __eou__
no . Not Tor . Creating an Interet that the government can not shut down . Wifi LAN routers make up the nodes . __eou__
thx __eou__
I don't use " ubuntu-desktop ". I use " kubuntu-desktop ". I know perfectly well that GNOME/Unity depend on Pulse . KDE , however , does not . __eou__ I know what Kubuntu is . That factoid is useless . __eou__
Yes , plain ALSA , I have a KDE setup ( pretty much default Kubuntu setup , but removed Pulse ) __eou__ It appears that ALSA doesn't realise that I unplug the headphones . __eou__ Not sure what you mean by " **unknown** ", if you mean KMix I trieed __eou__
if you use Labels then the automounter will show whatever your " foo " label is like /media/foo handy __eou__
you mean on the end of the filenames , right ? __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
what about the **unknown** ? __eou__
yay ! it worked ! thanks ! __eou__ is permanent though ? because that would be the whole point ... __eou__
if the directory and the files are owned by that user then 755 is completely sufficient ( as some other process will need to read there ... ) __eou__
unetbootin finished the proccess . that means , my pen drive is ready ? __eou__
is this a server , desktop , or what iso image exactly you put on cd ? __eou__
no worries :) __eou__
Qemu __eou__
well chown < uname > __eou__
A controller can have more than one port ... and 2 controllers can share the same ports . E.g. an UHCI ( USB1 ) and an EHCI ( USB2 ) controller __eou__ When controllers share ports , when you connect a USB2 device the EHCI will claim the port __eou__
why ? __eou__
run the cooling lines into the bathroom to get cool water from the toilet . :) Best Mod ive ever seen . __eou__
thats system wide also . for all users . __eou__
hehe __eou__ ya __eou__ and that 's pretty aweesome __eou__ they should do what apple did : make a video showing off the features __eou__ ... and put it on their homepage __eou__
muelli , thanks __eou__
Np __eou__
or , start a terminal and do " tail -f /var/log/kern . log " and watch carefully __eou__
unless you purged the packages , configs shouldn't have been removed __eou__
if it matters any , i had a clean install of xp on earlier and did not have any issues __eou__ leads me to believe software related vs hardware __eou__
mmm haven't __eou__
No , I meant ... is this a hang immediately after installing , or does this happen after a regular system boot well after it was installed ? __eou__
i5 __eou__
the atom n450 is 64 __eou__
Look at the build log you pasted __eou__
. ... so list it __eou__ you have to put the device in to be able to block it from mounting in the first place . So why not just put it in , run sudo blkid and edit your etc/fstab like **unknown** > /mount/point ans specify ro instead of rw __eou__
yeah , unfortunately the site is down ... dunno if you were aware ... but anonymous swore revenge for it __eou__
I have , no go . __eou__
thanks a bunc , acpi workarounds did the trick __eou__
Thanks I will try my distribution 's forums first and if I have no luck I will try the Ubuntu forum . Thanks for the help though __eou__
sorry was reading emails .. Well Junk mail ... But it won't let me edit the connections and it doesn't even say there is a connection when i get in there the hard way __eou__
Bodhi . __eou__
I never got the prompt __eou__ Is there a way to remove it fully and start over ? __eou__
but if I want do it temporary for read-only mount than I can stop the udev service or ? __eou__
never had that problem and i install chrome on 5-10 systems per day __eou__
Apache2 is running __eou__
.. Your clearly not intelligent enough to understand the context in which the comment is made . I will go back too scripting now . __eou__
This is on a new install , I get the menu for " boot from cd , live boot , blah blah ". With alt version I get the Ubuntu - - - - splash screen . __eou__ After those , it goes into this . __eou__
Would that be openssl-dev ? On CentOS its openssl-devel but not sure what it is on Ubuntu . __eou__ just saw your MSG , trying to install that now . __eou__ That worked , and now Apache is building without any issues . Thanks for the help . :) __eou__
yes mitsu __eou__ probably __eou__
I would make some suggestions but not being backed up wont allow me really . __eou__
I've bridged it to my Wifi modem and it is not giving a IP address . __eou__
.. sorry but what is DE ? :) __eou__ i did it to .. but it seems like a bug __eou__
it says for primary network interface ( but I am not using eth0 here ) iface eth0 inet dhcp __eou__ I am using eth2 ( wifi ) __eou__
yes , newer versions __eou__
use the line shoiwn with the correct drive and partition I would think . __eou__
You asked the very question I was going to ask . Except , you asked me . __eou__
it should update the bootloader list if you installed it and it doesn't show up thats what it 's used for __eou__ i've never tried it with a flash drive but still __eou__
I fail life ) : its 5am here . My brain doesn't work in the morning . I love you . < 3 __eou__
I was hoping not to use that because it requires a net connection and mine isn't very good . __eou__
did you press the alt option key ? __eou__ during bootup ? __eou__ like I said I know very little about the new macs __eou__ :) __eou__
ok let me read that , will be back in a bit then ^_^ __eou__
yeah . Its not as good but it gets the job done . sudo apt-get install skype just won't seem to work . __eou__
also take a look at the tldp : http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/ and maybe http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/Spam-Filtering-for-MX/ __eou__
My path variable , when I add paths to it the executables contained therein still don't run . " No such file or directory ". __eou__
please dont hate me i still have errors __eou__ http://pastebin.com/yLkYEK8F __eou__ but i did run those keys __eou__ and it helped __eou__ jus tthis stuff now __eou__
WACOMalt ... strange ... this drive has been working very well ... This machine here is a hackintosh and my SSD has got OSX on it ... since I installed Ubuntu on my secondary hdd ... I can't even boot on my SSD ... __eou__ Let me just try to swap the sata port ... __eou__ prodigy ... your question reveals how much you don't know about the pilosophy __eou__ I tried 3 ports and still nothing __eou__
yea , i'll get around to it someday . i use gnome fallback ... i hate unity __eou__
yup __eou__
would like to fix it tho , it 's annoying to get update-manager nags about " broken count > 1 " errors , silly thing :P __eou__
that ' bug ' has been popping up over the last few months . How can I clean it up for when i use dpkg __eou__
cursing ? you mean examancer saying **unknown** ? __eou__
thanks for the help ; it worked ... I love you . __eou__
how can i use it cuz __eou__ i want to share with others __eou__ so how can link pc by this router __eou__
Hdd is working like this about 6 months , nothing missed , but system lagging a lot ... I just thought there is a way to make it work better by locking those sectors .. __eou__
see ? :) __eou__
Data stream = one connection ? __eou__ Sorry . My question is , does Ubuntu support Wireless N , or do I need to stick to G ? __eou__
I dunno , pretty sure I didn't use a howto __eou__ if you have an external ; SATA port , I've found that installing to an SSD connected to that works amazingly well __eou__
you can make a persistance so changes stick __eou__
ah yes . __eou__ do you know how to do that on a mac ? __eou__ how so ? __eou__
oh , what 's the easiest way then ? The other 2 options sounded too scary to try out : ) __eou__ but then doesn't the boot loader installt o the hard drive and crap out the host OS ? __eou__ we like smart soft :D __eou__ if it 's that simple why does the option 2 . Erase Disk and install ubuntu come with a red WARNING that all programs , docs , etc will be **unknown** ? __eou__
phew , so somebody is logged on with xm console ? __eou__
right __eou__
partition USB into an 800MB swap partition and the rest as an ext4 " / " partition and make sure bootloader installs to the USB . __eou__
I know , I'm installing to USB because gf doesn't want to risk loosing Win and Live CD is just too slow . __eou__
I have been tring to run win in a virtualbox but it is verys low __eou__ yes , I did __eou__
TYVM . how did you verify that it 's not in a fresh install of ubunut ? __eou__
precisely __eou__ how do i do that ? __eou__
isn't there some keyboard shortcuts editor exposed in the gui ? __eou__
cant seem to find any good guide __eou__
what I fear with that is that it will mess up the boot in the host OS __eou__ I've been trying to do this for the past 4 hours and **unknown** , which appears to have left , recommended Lili ( the Win software that creates USB linux ) but this turned out to be just another live USB disk ! __eou__
sudo apt-get install gnome-panel or in ubuntu center gnome-panel , after inst U should log off and select gnome without effects and then log in __eou__
it should be rebuilding the available file ... " dpkg -- **unknown** " told it to clear its knowledge about the old one __eou__ you should only have repositories for the version you are running __eou__ mono is in the repositories __eou__ maybe " mono-complete ", but I'm on 12.04 __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ I think by change resolution my problem is fix . Is it true ? __eou__
it doesn't like Tab . __eou__
Really ? I'm sure it 's possible using curl __eou__
is there a reliable version for it ? __eou__
I'm not sure __eou__ I've just seen that take a while in the past __eou__
My Ubuntu 12.04 is unable to both load anything related to the internet , and also unable to show any errors to do with it . __eou__
: Is it " software restricted by copyright or legal issues "? That looks like it is already ticked for me . __eou__ O actually I'm being an idiot . I'm trying to install multiverse on my server . Not my desktop . lol . __eou__
what torrents are you looking for and how is this related to ubuntu ? __eou__
then they're not in the photos app , so i have to save them all one by one ? __eou__
is that the exact full wording of the error ? __eou__ I would grep for ' type=InnoDB ' in /etc/mysql/ and possibly other places to try and track down the source of that __eou__
yep , just not commands in general :) __eou__
you can install webserver on your ubuntu __eou__
look at 10_linux and learn some thing , if you have enough understand you can edit it , but be carefully __eou__ are you haven't solved it ? __eou__
yes __eou__ http://picpaste.com/Screenshot_from_2012-09-16_09_50_06-wXxzGlUH.png __eou__ changed query to ENGINE=InnoDB in , /usr/share/dbconfig-common/data/pdns-backend-mysql/install/mysql and the query seems to have finished , seems the package is shipping with out dated schema __eou__
any logs i could check to help diagnose my error ? __eou__
that looks like the kind of tool I am looking for , thanks ! __eou__
so how can I edit that ? thank you for your pacience __eou__
the ati driver causes video stuttering and has no 3d acceleration so it is worse thatn the opensource one with my card . i just expect a workign 3d graphics __eou__
sorry , in my experience using external displays depends mostly on the graphics card and driver and os settings , the bios hardly enters into the picture __eou__ perhaps its screensaver settings or what to do when the lid closes ( power settings ) __eou__
sure , but support ends next month __eou__
I know ... that is why I said to ls ( list ) its contents . If it is empty that answers the question ... however I dont know what i18n is ... and your problem connecting is to a cononical repo ... so that also answers that . __eou__ ^ __eou__
no problem __eou__ i know i got some idea from man page but " It must be running on the host to be able to make __eou__

buy way that proxy apeared in first place i didnt put it . did i get hacked ? __eou__
heh , I thought an option like unattended upgrades might have some timer option settings ... guess I'm mistaken , can't even find the settings in synaptic __eou__
I don't think so . I did " sudo -s -u mysql ", and it can't write to ANY name in /tmp __eou__
where you saw that __eou__
thanks , I will __eou__ thanks , that helped :) __eou__
figured :) __eou__
if you do unattended-upgrades -d , that might tell you a few things ? __eou__
I thought it did more . Let me see find that page __eou__ foudn it . It 's called PhotoRec . and it supports more than photo formats . see http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/File_Formats_Recovered_By_PhotoRec __eou__
shihan : where is located ?... __eou__
seems like compiz is a little too heavy for your system then __eou__
awesome __eou__ sounds like you need bridged networking __eou__
you should ( 1 ) run " check the cd for defects " from the first menu you see when booting , and ( 2 ) if that doesn't work or isn't available , just use the alternate install cd __eou__
was your ubuntu a complete installation or with errors , that didn't install some packages . __eou__

that part i knew ... mainly used for cmdline ... but the per-process net statistics are nice . there should be cli tools also to display bandwidth etc there ... __eou__
Hmmm they are just sniffers correct ? __eou__
You don't as such . iptables is just a program that injects rules into the kerne 's netfilters tables ... what you can do is clear all rules and reload a predefined set __eou__
multi-arch lets you install i386 packages on an amd64 system for example __eou__ imo it 's not worth it to do that since in a given release of ubuntu the versions aren't going to significantly change . If you insist on doing it though , both the apt-on-cd suggestion or lvm snapshot suggestion should work __eou__
ah __eou__
Well most are not complex enough to heat up a server __eou__

ok , i will check it __eou__

12.04 . 1 LTS __eou__
What is the other Operating System ? __eou__
NP __eou__
Ran disk analyzer . The results are a little complicated , but it looks like I should still have lots of space . __eou__
#wine is invite only __eou__
have a look at the " tune2fs " man page , under the " -m " switch option . __eou__ there 's nothing wrong with the disk ( in all **unknown** . the default reservation ( for the superuser ) is 5% of the filesystem , which i notice is the exact amount you're missing . __eou__
okay , thanks .. let 's go on __eou__
its the same in windows ..... __eou__
that does not sound like a grub issue . __eou__ **unknown** . cfg __eou__ true . editing that file will likely break something if you are not familiar __eou__
that 's exactly what I'm trying to avoid . I've already got my desktop looking damn near an exact clone of ubuntu __eou__
thank you very much ! __eou__ a half of freedos program ported from ubuntu/linux ) __eou__
Ah , I never was comfortable with them on the left side . I'll probably leave it as is :P __eou__

howdy __eou__ if you run : ls ~/Desktop are the files there ? __eou__
To be 100% sure you could remove the drive with windows on it and then put it back in after you have installed ubuntu . That will require you to run a couple of commands after you put the drive back to be able to select windows when you want to boot it but it is simple to do . __eou__ to install using wubi you need to boot to windows first , then double click the wubi . exe . basically it install ubuntu as a file in windows . __eou__
Dont be quiet :/ __eou__ thanks ' __eou__
So the syntax would be " bar | time-consuming-command -- parameters ", right ? __eou__ I am asking , since there is no manual entry for " bar ". __eou__ My bad , it was simply not installed . __eou__

For upstart you have to edit/rename the service 's entry in **unknown** . conf - but even on Precise , apache2 still uses SYSV init , so you can use chkconfig __eou__ In a rush I simply delete the symlinks in /etc/rc* . **unknown** to the service __eou__

I did that . No Ubuntu . __eou__

looks like its being updated . I used to have the file in my dropbox too :( __eou__ if someone else has it then you can run it , its also in Quantal by default too , but sadly not in Precise which I am on __eou__
ok , yeah this was already in the file the error happened after a dist-update __eou__
Dunno , to be honest __eou__
OK , tuning the kernel knob will be sufficient then __eou__
seems to default to ' y ' __eou__
ty __eou__
virsh ... **unknown** . kvm staright-up ftw IMO . __eou__ " requiring CPU virtualization " is a down side . but main-line linux-kernel support ... choice seems easy to me . __eou__

what are you compiling , and what 's the error ? __eou__ yes __eou__ I was just about to say , if you pop the error you get into Google it returns exactly *one* result __eou__ and that 's it __eou__ right , it 's not picking up the flag to tell it to link against the maths libs __eou__ aha ! __eou__ I looked at the last couple of lines of error output and noticed that it said something like " gcc -lm **unknown** **unknown** " __eou__ I've run into this before __eou__ now you need someone skilled in the art of fixing Makefiles __eou__

searching for terms like " best filesystem for sd card linux " type of thing . Interesting reading , but nothing will replace your own personal experience . __eou__ I can also say that if you are planning to use the card in other systems , nothing beats good old VFAT ( the DOS filesystem ) for portability . __eou__
yes . __eou__
ok , thx __eou__

ok thanks man __eou__
What do you mean ? __eou__
remove the lines if they are no help __eou__ are there any bugs reported ? __eou__
Its not that its not working , but its a minimal install so It dosnt have ALSA or anything included . I tried doing it myself last time but I belive I messed some things up so i re-installed __eou__
is it already in fstab ? __eou__ my original fstab has nothing indicating /var - how can i make it like that . __eou__ i want the partition itself to identify itself as /var and /home . like before __eou__

Sorry , I'm not familiar with ' **unknown** is this something you can do with xmonad or otherwise ? __eou__
if you append " text ", then you end up at a tty . If you don't and just stick with lightdm , then you can just choose " user xsession script " as your session from the lightdm login screen and it will log you into awesome __eou__ if you want to skip the logging in part , then you can enable auto-login in lightdm __eou__
Yeah , just try : gnome-control-center __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Exactly , because you can't. Are you trying to remove Unity ? __eou__ Yes , if you want to replace it with the gnome desktop instead . Go for it . __eou__
thank you JasonO __eou__ there doesn't seem to be a way to disable Unity from taking over the Super key in Keyboard , just a way to set/disable some custom keyboard shortcuts __eou__ Sure , why not JasonO . I was under the impression this is a difficult thing to do with Ubuntu 12.04 . I guess I should search online for steps to do this . __eou__
thanks ill give that a look __eou__
I know that , but what do you mean ? __eou__
why am i getting so many permission denied responses from that command ? y do i have to do this as root ? __eou__

I can't help ... no experience with that setup . __eou__
I logged in , but it 's now alternating characters between the root terminal and my user terminal __eou__
How would I do that ? __eou__
what about the others services ? that was automatically stopped ? __eou__
grub __eou__
haha , but still , Windows recognizes it by default :( __eou__
til April 2013 __eou__ that won't do anything :) __eou__ the changes in /dev won't stick as they are in tempfs :) __eou__
you won't if you add it correctly , that 's my main point __eou__ if you use the add-apt-repository command with the ppa address ( shown in bold on the ppa web page ) you won't have an issue __eou__ what are you hacking exactly ? __eou__
so how is this any different ? __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
ok __eou__
is that in 12.04 ? __eou__
: am at really is noob ( newbie ) but reading is so useful __eou__
all be good here ? __eou__
what ? XD __eou__
actually , search for ' pulseaudio ' in software center , there 's pulseuaudio settings tool __eou__
think about it if wine says yes I agree that I will not use this text on a linux box from a linux box you have broken the agreement when you say yes __eou__ it is very important to read eula 's __eou__
thats about all I know on the subject . i know you need to learn about how the drivers work or find a progam that can manipulate audio devices for ubuntu __eou__
It 's not actually doing anything yet . __eou__
So , doubleclick all of them until I find the right one ? __eou__
Not working for me , using Terminator , thanks though __eou__

Were you asked to sign in to " Ubuntu Single Sign On "? __eou__ When you say the " ubuntu software center " website , do you mean the page which is displayed within Ubuntu Software Center , or are you accessing this via a web browser ? __eou__
I cant acces the folder , but i can see it __eou__ I dont even want to see it __eou__ Is there a way to achieve that ? __eou__

you could try adding an older repo ( i.e. lucid ) but I wouldn't recommend it __eou__ what he said ^^^ __eou__
You create a ' bare ' repository then __eou__ I wrote an article on doing it some time ago ; it may be useful to you . http://tjworld.net/wiki/Howto/GitPublicRepositoryInstallAndConfigure __eou__
well that solution works for me , why not for you ? __eou__
i am not migrating :) __eou__
What exactly are you trying to do ? __eou__ Are you trying to connect to and access a network printer ? __eou__ If so , direct your browser ( firefox preferrably ) to localhost : 631 __eou__ localhost : 631 __eou__ Cups will more-than-likely find it for you . __eou__
i think thats why update manager very desruptive for me __eou__
12.04 __eou__
no , let me try it . __eou__ but I would like to install the " important updates " only . Will that install everything else , too ? __eou__
I can tell you this ... it 's not at all hard if you've used linux professionaly for 4years , but it 's a royal pain ... __eou__
linux it 's self does not take much resources it 's only the X / Window manager .. you could run 12.04 with a light weight window manager like blackbox or xfce __eou__
sudo chmod u+r filename __eou__
ok I see __eou__ I didn't have problems in Firefox __eou__ so , isn't that odd ? __eou__
going to give this printer a good smack and never buy another cheep inkjet __eou__ : typo __eou__ sry , two different networks ? __eou__

doing that ln does make it work again but i feel like that would bork up my apache server . __eou__
thx for advice , so network manager might be solution to this problem I think __eou__
the changes to live you make will not apply to the fresh install of ubuntu to hdd , yes it will only do a fresh base install so you will have to reinstall the additional packages __eou__
i have removed the iptable entry it is is working __eou__ i moved **unknown** . rules to the beginning and now it is working how it should , it is saying : tar : **unknown** . rules : Cannot stat : No such file or directory __eou__
what is " better "? there will be no guarantee ever so its on your decision __eou__
start over ? what do you mean ? __eou__ what will break ? __eou__
i tried getting that to work but that didnt help __eou__
1 ) setup pre-shared keys 2 ) use a passphrase 3 ) limit the number of allowed active ssh connections 4 ) change the port from the standard port 22 5 ) configure your os firewall ( ufw ) to only allow connections from the IPs you want to access it 6 ) do the same thing on the network firewall/router __eou__ oh and deny root access of course __eou__ 4 ) and 5 ) are a bit redundant but i'm paranoid __eou__
not that i am aware of . it 's a different user session , so i'd think you'd have to close your current session to launch a new one __eou__

huh ? __eou__
which , moving back to apt-x or trying to get apt to tell me why ? :) Honestly , the issue I think I'm more concerned about is : that since I haven't used apt-get dist-upgrade in a very long time and since at the time it was used to upgrade from one distro to another , I am a little leery of arbitrarily issuing a dist-upgrade . I get that so long as my repos haven't changed I should be fine . still and all , dist-upgrad __eou__
Thanks . I'm just trying to find another use for this Asus eee 900 other than the trash can __eou__ used to have Ubuntu netbook 10 , but then I experimented with several other things ( android , chromium , joli ) etc , and coming back to Ubuntu __eou__

thats normal __eou__
That process has been automated . __eou__

Thank you for the clarification on that . That is certainly unusual . __eou__
I don't believe that it would be a good idea to prevent a login of any sort for any specied period of time . __eou__
If I had to guess , IP transfer traffic will always have a slightly higher count for bits/bytes because of header information . __eou__ Probably . To be honest , I don't specialize in this area . So I don't know that I could give you an answer that would be overly helpful . __eou__ Aye . Though keep in mind , most of your would-be hackers are " script kiddies ". __eou__ If you're using Ubuntu server , you have it covered like a jimmy hat . __eou__
well if you saw it between that many versions then its a hardware issue of some sort . once I noticed that all the video on one of my pcs had artifacts all of a sudden . I did everything to figure out what the problem was with what driver . turned out it was one of the cores id unlocked in bios on my cpu . worked for 2 years and then all of a sudden caused problems __eou__
i know ubuntu uses 2 logs for kernel these days ( but i'm affraid i don't know the names ) __eou__ syslog and messages i guess ... so you probably already checked them ... __eou__
anyone here got ubuntu on a mac __eou__

Might possibly be a screensaver . You wouldn't by any chance be using LXDE ? __eou__ " xset dpms force off " < -- seen that before ? __eou__
That again is not what I'm asking about . __eou__ Again , my query was simple : " How does one reload the iptables rules that are loaded at boot ?" __eou__
I'd recommend letting the memtest do at least 1 complete test cycle __eou__
He reconnected , and I suspected that the floodbots were just going to unquiet him again , which ... __eou__ ty Jordan_U __eou__
When I run , " service ufw start/restart " it does indeed establish/reestablish the default ruleset as configured in the ufw configs . However , if you want to remove the ruleset , it seems you still have to do it manually ( ie . sudo iptables -F and sudo iptables -t nat -F ) __eou__
the easiest way is good ole scp __eou__
yes , but I'm not going to kid myself into thinking I can do anything well so soon . __eou__
i think it happens with java6 also __eou__ that is , openjdk-6-jre __eou__
Thanks for your help . I will make my way to #apple to see if they can help me __eou__

In my experience , that 's usually messy . Copy the files , then do a chmod -r to recursively change permissions , or chown -r to change owners , but then it will change everything to be the same . I'll leave it to somebody else if there is a better way . __eou__

that makes sense . A mount point is the directory that you specify to use as the base for the file system on the USB ( or **unknown** .

Yes , he is rather confusing regarding WUBI ; you need to read his entire site to fully understand his rationale , but , I don't particularly agree with him ; at least on that point . __eou__ That screenshot may be from a previous version of ubuntu . __eou__ Are you familiar with http://ubuntuforums.org ? __eou__
no kidding ... __eou__
32-bit is best for 2GB or less ; 64-bit will show benefits for 4GB+ __eou__

okay __eou__ and then ? __eou__
Yeah , there are some issues until all the libraries are sorted out . I've hit a few issues with overlapping -dev packages __eou__
cool .. that still doesn't help the building issue ;) __eou__
No , plain command to fetch particular flag description __eou__
I do it all the time . The stick has drivers installed and I switch between them as necessary . __eou__
I used a windows , during the installation ( Vista ) i had the option to delete __eou__
Yeah , the HD size is 750 MB allocated 500 to Vista , the rest was Mint and just deleted it __eou__
i guess that might work .. __eou__
why it should be on __eou__ there are no services installed by default __eou__
have you been the Ubuntu Audio Development Team page ? __eou__
Well , I can't really help you on that ( just saying things that I thought might help , sorry , I don't even know what a " SLI " is ) __eou__
Sure . __eou__

Installed . __eou__ The netbook also features the non-graphical installer . __eou__
/dev/sdb1 : UUID= " **unknown** " TYPE= " ntfs " __eou__
ah , okay ;-) __eou__
You just need to set the sticky bit on the parent directory " chmod +t **unknown** > " __eou__ That ensures that only the *owner* can do deletions __eou__
me neither . __eou__
no idea . __eou__ i doubt sudo would/should matter . __eou__ s/sudo/sudo access __eou__ you don't run startx with ssh X forwarding ! __eou__
possibly __eou__
i did not argue . __eou__
ok __eou__
: from what you said you wanted to do , you'd do the fresh ubuntu install on SDA , then setup drive SDB and add it to your fstab file __eou__
thx , I'll give it a shot __eou__

ahhh I see __eou__
Right now I'm on sda10 running 12.04 . It has 4 kernels installed , and GRUB2 menu shows 8 entries __eou__ I want my old kernel versions to stay there , but want any other duplicates to stay . I know I have several OS installed and the real number of menu entries should be around 15-16 . But I have 48 after running Grub Customizer application . __eou__
Strange ... perhaps you need to refresh your session ( **unknown** ... dunno ... __eou__
do you have admin privileges ? __eou__ so you CAN change the language but it wont stay changed ? __eou__
if you boot to ubuntu and run : sudo modprobe ndiswrapper does it load ok and work ? __eou__
you don't have to ask . just wait for an issue you are interested in to be asked by someone . __eou__
right . so i can't help you . good luck . __eou__
oh man , not seen taht film in ages __eou__ german ... means thank you __eou__
i had her seesion set up for spanish when i had mandriva installed but since mandriva doesn't have adequate support i changed all my pc 's to ubuntu - anyway , it should have been a " slam-dunk " to set her up on ubuntu __eou__
nope ... good luck . __eou__
:) that 's right up there with my belief " You don't get , if you don't ask " __eou__
nothing really , I'm just exploring __eou__
I mean X11 desktop in a window __eou__
thanks for the short and to-the-point answer __eou__
It 's up to you . ( But I like to give extra space . for instance , 100M is enough for boot , I suggest 200M , 4M is enough for swap , I recommend 8M ) __eou__ The thing you really want is to leave as much as possible for /home/ __eou__ I stand by my original recommendation . __eou__
: if you want to be microsoft compatible , there is samba __eou__
That joins you to the #debian channel on this server ( freenode ) __eou__
Install the OS ? __eou__ Do you mean I'm missing some kind of dependency for Nautilus ? __eou__
Do you remember , ( a few years ago) , we did everything on a system with < 1M RAM ? And a few years before that , someone said that he didn't see why anyone would ever need more that 512k ? :) :) :) :) __eou__
no problem . Basically , that ~/ . profile gets executed one time at login , but your . bashrc gets executed at login ( because . profile sources it ) and also when you open a new shell __eou__
One of the networks , suck as ' Debian Serves ' and ' **unknown** ' __eou__

blackshirt : I did not tweak anything about the network until this morning . After faceing this problem , I added'dns-nameservers 8.8 . 8.8 ' to /etc/network/interfaces . __eou__
**unknown** , i think linux manage memory very **unknown** , and sometimes swap was not used mostly __eou__
no , I used it last about a year ago . I mixed up the client/server terminology . I think you'd have better luck in #macOSX , those guys seem to be more powerusers . __eou__
The only card in my system is a video card , which seems to be working fine . What makes you think it would be an unseated card ? __eou__

Does anyone know how to install ubuntu with virtual box ? Can they help me out/guide me though it ? I am using windows , but i want to run Ubuntu on a VM , I have both the Ubuntu . iso and virtual box installed on this computer installed __eou__
fair enough , but if you do ever feel like diving into command line , you sould do it in one line of typing and zero clicks __eou__
have you ever measured the time it took to get from scratch to a windows system ( incl . applications ) which " works 100% "? __eou__
Truecrypt unfortunately only does this service for windows partitions from what I understand __eou__
I dono . What are you tring to do ? __eou__
I didn't choose my laptop anticipating to use Linux :P __eou__ it was just a cheap deal __eou__
the JDK is used to develop Java applications . You need the JRE to run Java applications . __eou__
true , but its 's still crazy that they would forbid them from doing the work in octave __eou__
you would ssh to the server and run screen on the server __eou__ http://kb.iu.edu/data/acuy.html may be a good read __eou__
can you explain what it does ? what is 755 ? __eou__
i'd try the commands I gave . Source ; http://askubuntu.com/questions/117127/flash-video-appears-blue __eou__
atm i am on xubuntu live usb __eou__
What exactly are you trying to do ? __eou__
that seemd to have fixed it . thank you very much __eou__
apt sources are where software you install with these tools comes from . they define which software is available using these utilities . __eou__ why did you add this PPA in the first place ? usually people do this when they want to install some software which is not already available in ubuntu __eou__
maybe someone likes the idea and picks it up __eou__
yes , the newer version use different environment compared to old .. and maybe need some more capable hardware .. thats commonly happen . __eou__
hell if i know . I only have ubuntu running as a server __eou__
chromium can only test the upstream version of your plugin , it cannot interpret which ( security ) patches may have been applied to it . __eou__ so your java plugin could be safely patched thanks to the debian and ubuntu security teams , and chromium would still report its unsafe . __eou__ same for firefox . in this very case , though , there is no safe version . __eou__
I don't get that option when I right click . It 's a PDF file . __eou__
well i don't use unity , gnome , or kde but in previous gnome versions i always had to pick the right output speakers __eou__ http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/1548/screenshotsoundpreferen.png __eou__
I just tried typing ' cssh host1 host2 ' and got three windows , one for each host and one for commands . You sure you're not getting that ? __eou__
i really don't know then , sound like it could be a hardware issue __eou__
you mean in january 2012 ? __eou__ ubuntu 11.10 then , yes i think so , too . __eou__
yes , well , no , I need just to reduce the font size , the rest is black . __eou__
so after I finish learning shell script and cron jobs I am still not sure if I will be able to set up a backup rsync system where if it does not run at a specific time it pops up an error whenever I next switch on the system or sth __eou__
that 's appreciated . :) __eou__
pretty sure that is created by the package __eou__
ooo __eou__
I had a setup b4 . Just jacked it up , so I'm starting over . Host offers server and LTS wasn't sure of the differences . But now I know :) __eou__ I'm name my first born Precise Pangolin ... __eou__
i run linux mint and debian and pear linux no i never heard of the distro mono __eou__ you run with it in wine and make sure that it is allowed to execute __eou__
Purge just removes the configuration files of that package . I think that something like ; apt-get purge nginx ; apt-get autoremove -- purge ; will do about what you want __eou__
ok , great , __eou__
do you mean " rm -f /etc/init . **unknown** " in the third queued command ? __eou__
Yeah I was just gonna say . I'll keep searching , and if I find one . I'll come back and tell you all about it .. Thanks __eou__
i think buglyjoe can help you __eou__
having a look at xorg . * . log and . xsession-errors might have been an option , hadn't thought of that , yet . but that'd probably been a bit too cumbersome , too . __eou__

: I was in another window , sorry __eou__ : could you login using another wm and rename the . **unknown** folder to something else __eou__ : this is where awesome keeps all its settings __eou__ : the . **unknown** folder of the user who can't login , so you will probably need to switch to superuser __eou__
thanks will do that , I am not familiar with jockey-gtk but will google it . thx __eou__
whid other user , I can . but with my user I logined but the I logout automaticaly __eou__
so basically - maybe i have just overseen it - you mentioned you might need help - but not anything else - which reduces your chances to actually -'get help ' heavily as users inhere cant read brains ;) __eou__
the colours are set on your local machine __eou__

found it . Any way to default nosplash to grub-update after new kernel or something ? __eou__
disappointed : Sarcastic jab at having asked for assistance in something , but gotten a message completely unrelated to the problem . :P __eou__
yes , **unknown** goes to deepth on ubuntu , you can't easilly remove it without breaking entire all system __eou__

**unknown** . wine/ __eou__
are you ? __eou__
ok , I understand . I guess that what I don't understand is the way the updates are applied . As I understand your answer , for updates requiring reboot , the update is a totally new version of the lib that is replaced . Right ? The updates don't somehow " patch " older files , so if 3 updates of the same lib are applied , the pacakge is simply replaced completely with every newer version ? Correct ? __eou__ so in my example , the 2 first updates just get " smashed out " by the 3rd at the reboot , yes ? __eou__
yes , but in the eventuality that one or more updates are already " pending " ( applied , but requiring reboot) . What happens when a newer get applied , that also asks for reboot ? Sorry if my question is maybe difficult to understand ... __eou__
ok , next time before delete i have a look at logs __eou__
I will , but afaik Uninty2d is removed in Ubuntu 12.10 . Plus , I think Unity as such is rather bloated . __eou__

yes . I don't know much about programming ( i learnt C++ a long time ago ) but i think i could build one . I'm just looking somewhere if it exists .

Let me try that , thanks . __eou__
when i try to change the password , i get message " authentication token manipulation error " __eou__

You can download it from the repository . It 's known as " Windows Wireless Drivers " in your menu . __eou__
was exactly my thoughts , that was the first file i checked , there is however nothing similar __eou__
tried davmail and it doesn't work either .. probably because all the ports are all blocked __eou__
yes ! thank you ! i didn't put export , with that it works great . __eou__

no . You can't do calculations as part of the parameters to ' dd ' . You have to work the values out in decimal , first , and use those directly __eou__ And remember **unknown** ' is the number of 512-byte sectors to miss , so make sure ' skip ' is in sectors not bytes __eou__

your desktop runs the xfwm4 windows manager and thats about it . all the " nice " desktop stuff isn't there and wont work . you need to be running some kind of dbus session with a session manager to have that stuff . the udev/udisks doesn't even know that anyone is logged in with that Xsession __eou__

Ah , cool :-) __eou__ It probably says something like " sudo update-grub " and the like ... __eou__ I don't know , but my guess would be to run " sudo update-grub " in a terminal and watch the output carefully . If the output is okay ( i.e. a windows system was recognized ) I'd do a " sudo grub-install /dev/sda ( If that 's Your harddisk) . __eou__ Any success ??? __eou__ What didn't work precisely ? __eou__ What exactely did You enter ? Surely not " /dev/XXX "... __eou__ The XXX is a placeholder for Your actual 1st harddrive which is very likely " sda ". __eou__ Yes , hehe , sure ... moment .... __eou__ Any . Grub will be written to the MBR of the harddrive . __eou__ " sudo fdisk -l ", and tell me the very first entry . __eou__ Okay , fine . Those are the partitions on sda , the first ( and only ) harddrive . Into the MBR , the very first section of this harddrive , where the harddrive is told that it is a harddrive and what 's on it Grub will be written via " sudo grub-install /dev/sda " __eou__ I'd say yes . Any comments ??? __eou__ Ooops __eou__ Are You in a live system now ??? __eou__ Sorry , I thought You somehow managed to get Your ubuntu on the harddrive booted . From a Live-CD the grub-install won't work , of course . My fault . __eou__ Wait . Maybe a nice guy from this chat could go with You through the chroot thingy , an alternative way of repairing grub while You're in Your Live system ... __eou__ Yup , ubuntu is on sda4 __eou__ Yes , I see . It just looks like there 's nothing which could use it , i.e. no ubuntu ... : -| __eou__ You installed ubuntu in just one partition , I guess (/) ? __eou__
not in the mood for trolling __eou__
If run from a chroot or the alternative or within the desktop yes , from a live cd no chroot no . __eou__ It seems L3top has it under control , yours was an easy mistake , I have done it a many of times , it can be difficult to get all the info , and people start to pile on helping . ;) __eou__

Are you on the desktop ? Is this grub 2 ? __eou__
Yeah , it was set up initially by **unknown** , i just changed the file , but it 's neither locking out the old key nor accepting the new one __eou__

the size of the log files __eou__
how big is your root partition ? __eou__
i am glad to see it =) __eou__
what does your machine tell you ? __eou__
try it and see , if you are using software from outside the repos that will likely create problems though __eou__
I see , however I think it originally had in osx __eou__ I keep getting conflicting info __eou__ it`s not so much the acceleration and 3D effects , but more actual activation of graphics card __eou__
do you think that was some kind of rare hickup and i could forget about it ? __eou__ thx __eou__
does not work __eou__ autodetection of a filesystem failed __eou__
oki __eou__ following that but i dont want to wipe that partition since it is my old 12.04 install __eou__
also http://what-if.xkcd.com __eou__ memory card readers don't need specific drivers __eou__
can i help you in any way ? __eou__
muon-update-manager may be set to LTS releases only . __eou__ open Muon Update manager , click on settings -> Configure software sources , go to the updates tab and make sure to select normal releases __eou__ hmm , if it was set to LTS only then 12.04 should be offered __eou__ in any case sudo do-release-upgrade will/should work . __eou__
why should he use anything else ? either he removes the config from /etc/network/interfaces and uses networkmanager or he corrects /etc/network/interfaces to get it working __eou__
sorry , im helping klpkt at the moment __eou__
good start . __eou__ terminal > ifconfig __eou__
You're right ; I have another computer which is a little older , and which works . It also runs Windows , which might help , because the other computer can connect if I'm on the Windows part of it . __eou__
http://pastebin.com/iaXBatYu __eou__
It isnt our mistake when you cant pastebin the easy way ;) __eou__
thats what i was afraid of ... thanks __eou__

genii-around told me yesterday to put in 8.8 . 8.8 as the DNS server , but it still doesn't work __eou__
is this wired connection ? eth0 ? __eou__
then why didn't this work ? __eou__ http://paste.ubuntu.com/1220462/ __eou__
should work with ' auto ' under DNS in the nm-applet settings ( network manager in system tray ) __eou__
good call llutz . __eou__
' noauto ' tells it to not mount it aty boot time __eou__ but when the user tells it to __eou__
i did not changed the / UUID __eou__
oh hey man :) __eou__
exist = has to be registered and needs an mx-record pointing to yur server __eou__
fsck said it made it ext3 but it is actually ext4 __eou__
in the extracted file i have got a 32bit and 64bit folders . as i am on 32 bit so now 32bit folder contains 1- Debain **unknown** folder __eou__
shouldn't be a problem __eou__ if you change graphics-adapter it might be a bit tricky too __eou__
Richard Stallman should disembowl your eunuch ass you cuckholded walled-garden loving ``open source '' charlatan __eou__
they did a test , and the feds can't crack it . I'm good . __eou__
MonkeyDust , I have lots of links : download links and I want to download it directly to ubuntu one cloud __eou__ yeah I am doing that :-) __eou__

using the console , make a backup directory in your probllem users home ,, them move the . gnome* and . **unknown** and perhaps some other directoryies to it . then try logging in to see what setting messed things up . BUT first . check who owns your . Xauthority file . it should not be owned by root __eou__
that 's TYPE= vfat . __eou__
not as nice as sony vegas or final cut , or avid ! __eou__
gparted should work fine , from live-cd __eou__
don't know , never used kde __eou__ you don't need squid __eou__

ok __eou__ any guide on that ? __eou__ hm .. __eou__ what will ssh-d do ? __eou__ thats what bind address is ? __eou__
in terminal it asks my password and none of my passwords are good __eou__
ive reinstalled several times with different distros . Even attempting to reinstall is very random . I have to boot several times on whichever media form to get the kernel to load before beginning to install __eou__
stil doesnt work __eou__
seperate partition __eou__
My laptop sounds like an airplane taking off . __eou__
I don't think so . I'm trying to double check in Synaptic but it crashes when I try to access the repositories page __eou__
I could have part of that incorrect , but the system is quite hosed . __eou__
nothing , just waiting for the fix in a update __eou__ i suppose I could disbale it but then again i never let my abttery get low enough to matter __eou__
Yeah I know . But there is a way of actually doing it by redirecting stdout and stderror using 2>&1 , I just always forget if it is 2>1& or 1>&2 etc __eou__ That way I don't have to go to that trouble :) __eou__
is the **unknown** . 0 Ethernet controller [ **unknown** : Atheros Communications Inc . AR2413 802.11 bg NIC [ **unknown** : 001a ] ( rev 01 ) your wifi or standard lan port ? __eou__
the thing is i'm using the 2.2 version of psad , which is not a problem atm , it 's just that iptables isn't logging at the default locations it **unknown** __eou__ seems* __eou__
I use qemu-kvm , and manage the vms with virt-manager . I dont do any hardware passthrough , and Im not sure it even works with kvm 1.0 __eou__ the best vdeo performance Ive seen is using virtualbox . I havent used xen in years , but maybe its better . dont know __eou__
32 bit installer for the nvidia drivers or Ubuntu ? __eou__
to create any simple image from **unknown** .... this kind __eou__ bmp , jpg , etc ... __eou__
you are Welcome __eou__
If this is the only install you will need to hold the shift key down after powering on to see grub if it is 12.04 . __eou__
i also think it might be kernel : [ **unknown** ] hp_wmi : Unknown event_id - 10 - 0x1 __eou__
no , but isn't 127.0 . 0.1 localhost ? __eou__
and its fully up to date ? __eou__
I think you'll need to submit a bug if you want to see it change . __eou__ you could also check on irc.gnome.org and see if any of the #gnome guys will help you . Though that is somewhat rare . __eou__
Besides there is more than just using a hypervisor to pass through hardware to an HVM to play __eou__ that I want to do __eou__
In that case , all Ubuntu hosts should have that problem , which they dont . __eou__
yes __eou__
" grep -r spotify /etc/apt/* " remove one of the duplicate entries __eou__
yeah take out that TYPE= part __eou__
sudo apt-get purge unity-lens-shopping has a contact us button at the top right of every page . Like I said this is not an Ubuntu issue and as mentioned . amz files are basically links for the Amazon Downloader __eou__ oops , seems I pasted a command that is not related to you lol __eou__
from the sounds of it an old one . how do i find out ? __eou__
i think now , i am allowed to edit files .. but when viewing **unknown** not allowed __eou__ i tried changing using su __eou__ its only for personal use in a VM __eou__ sry __eou__
yes __eou__ it is a software issue , they wake up when i move the mouse __eou__
you'll love it __eou__ I am joking , but you will probably enjoy learning about it __eou__ well it 's a step up from opening your hard drive up and using a magnet __eou__
yep , you just use update-manager ( see ubottu 's links ) __eou__
I don't follow . Is there something explaining that ? __eou__
fine :) __eou__
well I'm not sure it will do what you ask ; I haven't used it in a very long time __eou__
this channel is for *technical support* with *released* versions . You can discuss it in #ubuntu-offtopic though , it 's a real channel __eou__ as I said , please don't discuss it here __eou__
TJ- : sorry guys :( __eou__ Like when I'm doing loadkeys be I get a qwerty keyboard with __eou__
YES ! __eou__
you could go get a thumb drive and put the swap on that , lol __eou__
when i did that last time , said bot told me to use ! ask __eou__
oh __eou__ sadly I cannot output the text this way as the computer has no internet __eou__
do people really forgo swap in general on SSD's? __eou__
yes just a sec __eou__
I ran that and I got a weird message , " Ignoring unknown interface eth0=eth0 " and still not working __eou__
I've been getting this weird issue where every once in a while a random keystroke or mouse movement will get stuck and just keep sending over and over again to where I can't even use the shortcut to kill X __eou__
ya ( sorry misunderstood your **unknown** . they should almost be identical ! __eou__
I know . So there 's something misconfigured somewhere . As I said earlier , if N-M is managing the interface you'll see copious messages in /var/log/syslog when it does . Try a " grep eth0 /var/log/syslog " and see if that helps you understand what 's doing it __eou__
oops /etc/resolv . conf __eou__ By default 12.04 sets /etc/resolv . conf to " nameserver 127.0 . 0.1 " __eou__
i didnt see what u said , give me a min __eou__ what did u recommend ? __eou__
?? __eou__
I will continue my quest , thanks ;) __eou__ X also handles all your pointers etc . I've added AutoAddDevices to one instance now . will see what that does __eou__
that said it appears " grub- 2.00 " has been releasetd more recently ... after 12.04 __eou__ ftp :/ / **unknown** look at the dates/times __eou__
you could ask #ubuntu-server for confirmation i'm sure . __eou__ my network-manager i probably the wrong process name , but i didn't think nm-applet made ANY sense so didn't suggest that . __eou__ you could try " lsb_release -a " but i don't think " server " is mentioned - maybe ? __eou__ or possible the exact opposite ! __eou__ you should use N-M if you can ! __eou__
sorry . __eou__
so just service dhcp3 stop ? __eou__ ill look it up __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
depends on what exactly you want to do __eou__
shit , I'll have to give up emacs24 and racket __eou__
indeed __eou__

tyvm __eou__
how do i find out which one i am ? i simply run x-terminal-emulator __eou__
do you have a dock ? __eou__
! who | **unknown** , you are confusing sunil__ __eou__
Okay . __eou__ Right now my load is 0.00 0.01 0.05 . It generally starts climbing pretty soon here . __eou__
no problem __eou__
maybe acpi -V __eou__ you could browse /proc/acpi/ and then cat the corresponding file __eou__
not jst ls on it 's on , no , I don't believe so __eou__
well , if the x server can't get resolutions , you would ONLY see it in your /var/log/Xorg . 0 . log ( or whatever ) __eou__
ok , im not really concerned with windows , i just need to have linux boot normally __eou__
Anyone know how I can get a textual readout of battery information ? For running linux in a pure text environment in something like tmux ? __eou__ I will avenge his fans and family by making a holographic buckwheat ! __eou__

**unknown** : No . I do not . __eou__

STOP USING IT __eou__
lxde looks interesting , any comparison to kde ? __eou__
Have you seen the Amazon sellout ? __eou__
The information gathering isn't something I'd want though , so I simply won't use it . __eou__ Plus with the 1000 other options I have , why pick one that 's shoving advertisements down my throat right ? __eou__
i'd use software center .. one click install from there __eou__
then why are we wasting time and not doint a proper dual boot ? __eou__
there 's guides here and there , basically you need to know what ssl is all about .. __eou__
Thanks ! Everything went smoothly and I am now booted into the operating system ! __eou__
HAHAHA !! It worked ! Or , maybe it didn't..I'm not entirely sure I did all that much , but having the window in full screen before I startX seems to get it to occupy the entire window :) __eou__
thanks __eou__ wow , no-go via sudo either . __eou__ just got it going . I clicked on " Burn " and while it said " ni media in device " I found a refresh button and I'm on my way . but man , a real wtf of user experience __eou__
Ubunutu 12.04 freshly installed last night . I installed some driver to make LoL work in PlayOnLinux and now I don't think the pulseaudio thing is working correctly __eou__
so it 's offtopic here __eou__
you have access to terminal . run TOP and kill it that way __eou__
xangua Thanks . __eou__
" a bunch of stuff " means " I can't remember because it was a couple weeks ago " :/ __eou__ well it installing nvidi ORDERa drivers and removeing them and removing xorg-core and putting it back - but i CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER TH __eou__

i just plug in my ipod and it shows up in rhythmbox , then I can drag and drop mp3s from rhythmbox __eou__ I'm on 12.04 though __eou__
this is one of those things that just won't work yet __eou__
the sound itself works , but I cannot change volume or anything , and the volume control thing that is supposed to be in the system bar is not there , and when I go system settings > sound nothing shows up under the output device list __eou__
why can't i keep my current distro __eou__
have one that doesnt want to run correctly , and apparently the theme is the issue __eou__ can you name one ? __eou__
yeah , you actually have to try quite hard to do that ;-) __eou__
oh !!! hmm , I'm assuming it comes down to versions that ubuntu will use . Check what verions have it at kernel.org , then you should ask " **unknown** ersions are in ubuntu " __eou__
I burnt the iso to a cd and started it from an external usb cd rom __eou__ there is also an issue that most usb sticks tend to use sector 1024 as a start instead of 0 . By putting the iso on an external USB drive you might get lucy to install from that __eou__
I didn't. I was assigned the slow mirror when usiong the main download link at www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop __eou__ I chose a closer mirror after and maxed out my connection speed . __eou__

If only it was that simple . Remember , this is a MacBook , so booting to a CD is REALLY hard . __eou__
where is the " sudo "? __eou__
Ah , screw it , it is way too difficult for me , I don't understand a thing . I used the partitioningtool from the **unknown** . Thanks all for the help . Bye __eou__

" how do you know if the driver is graphics ?" What does that mean ? __eou__ there is something we can try . What model card do you have ? Please pastebin the output of sudo lspci -k so I can read it : paste.ubuntu.com __eou__
Check the nomodeset option , use the shift key to show the grub menu at powering on if this OS is the only install on the HD . __eou__ I have top get to writing some papers for a universiy course , your problem sounds easily fixable , others will help . __eou__

that meta package just doesn't have much else in it , but if you wanted gnome for instance , you need to pick out the right package :P __eou__
there is a way to get a gui without all the other stuff .. like libreoffice etc .. I just don't need that stuff . __eou__
Hmm , ok , sounds like you've got it under control ^_^ __eou__

I imagine , I don't really use software-center , the version numbers match the page you link though __eou__
you're being too vague to get a real answer but all you need is executable permission on a directory to " go inside it ". They just can't list the contents of the directory without read __eou__
ubuntu-desktop , lubuntu-desktop etc pull all packages .. I just want the gui not all the associated programs .. __eou__
it happens in unity ubuntu and lubuntu 's LXDE __eou__
how can I reconfigure my xorg in precise ? i've already tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and also Xorg -reconfigure , but does not work , in fact , i don't have xorg . conf file , so what command should i tried ? __eou__
incorrect file maybe . __eou__ yes , make it __eou__
if you are using 2d that explains your whole issue . __eou__
There are reasons . Have you came up with a reason it 's needed ? Other than to just do it ? __eou__

Well I was looking for some package with the webinterface , security managemnt and all already __eou__ not a roll your own , I'm pretty shitty with that stuff __eou__
can xen write-protect it 's bootsector etc ? __eou__
It seemed you said you had wifi until you added firmware , is this true and did you have it on the live cd ? __eou__
i only found chromium inside / . config folder not google-chrome __eou__
ok , so whatever option you have under gdm .. if its not there then a link wasnt made for it ( and you may need to make one manually , somewhere in /usr/share ) __eou__
I want to help you fix this ... you are making me less motivated to do so . __eou__
there _used_ to be an ubuntu-minimal install CD , that'd do that . I heard a rumor that it was going away , but I don't know . **unknown** , you could hack bootup scripts and/or uninstall all graphical software includeing X itself . __eou__
where is . /config located ? __eou__
sorry , must've missed that -- what 's up again ? __eou__ what 's up with your empty desktop again ? __eou__
this is my /var/log/xorg . **unknown** http://pastebin.com/VQyJQ6MH __eou__ the login window if i boot from grub as normal user , doesnt appear __eou__
Hmm I have a Broadcom card as well ( **unknown** ) and the " **unknown** " with the wl module is what works for me . __eou__
yea . i'm a fan of the general style . __eou__
yeah I tried that but that doesn't allow me to keep my settings after every time I boot . Instead I can either choose to install it or just run the demo , or to install it on my harddrive __eou__ ( sorry ) yeah I tried that but that doesn't allow me to keep my settings after every time I boot .

I want to get a computer to run ubuntu server , i don't need anything REALLY fancy . just decent amount of RAM **unknown** ) and a lot of storage . any recommendations __eou__
so you tried both drivers , proprietary one and free ? __eou__ that card can be really weird __eou__
is 12.10 dev buid __eou__
sorry I had to step away . Dont see it in the file manager , and believe I need to mount it , but I suspect the cdrom is a special case ... I see it in /dev but also see a /cdrom __eou__

for example unity-panel iirc __eou__
All packages are up-to-date . ' update-grub ' isn't an APT command : " E : Invalid operation update-grub ". __eou__ I'm well amused : all the grub stuff is in sh , it 's calling version_find_latest in back **unknown** nobody changes the **unknown** and yet , I can't find it anywhere sensible . Game well played . :) __eou__
you should set it when config __eou__
No worries ! I am trying to resend with formail if that makes it more relevant . __eou__ This command works - http://serverfault.com/questions/90023/how-can-i-send-var-mail-root-again __eou__ But it resends the fail message back to www-data , not the actual original email to a external address that failed in the first place . __eou__
read the INSTALL file ? __eou__ maybe this will help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AndroidSDK __eou__ jordanm 's answer was perfectly fine . I just googled it for you , that 's all __eou__
lol , i couldn't even find System tools __eou__
are you launching dbus after consolekit ? __eou__
so you have do **unknown** etc ? __eou__
hmm , odd __eou__ so maybe it wasn't ubuntu messing with the network ? __eou__
? __eou__
the ubuntu one is packaged for ubuntu already __eou__ the official version , unmodified __eou__
thanks , I hadn't thought of that . I see there 's a lot of software that might help __eou__
lol !!! __eou__
type each persons nick completely ( use TAB completion ) __eou__ don't expect to have a happy system if you're using packages that aren't built for the kernel you're using __eou__
you see it now __eou__
you see my post ... I said my self-installed software disappears __eou__
no , " tar xvf linux- 3.2 . 2 . tar . gz ", the " xvf " part are arguments to the tar command . in this case ' x ' for eXtract , ' v ' for Verbose , and ' f ' for Filename __eou__

I am following this link right now , will this work ? http://linuxtweaking.blogspot.com/2011/02/how-to-compile-kernel-from-kernelorg-in.html __eou__
good to know :D __eou__
How ? __eou__
luckly it has a hot key for boot order __eou__ but these days it just sits on the shelf __eou__ nedding parts im to lazy to order __eou__ and i got 3 newer laptops __eou__ like with any older tec cant sell it dont wanna trash it __eou__ was thinking of getting one of the ide to sd card adaptors being old ide drive are a bit hard to find these days __eou__
ok __eou__
gratz __eou__
it has been maximum of 63 " partitions " with IDE but theres a lower limit with **unknown** ) which is used since a while __eou__
checking it out now __eou__
yes me too , but have to do some hw tests ( instead of vm ones ) so didn't want to mess things up . Thanks . __eou__
ok :( __eou__
Ok . Thank you ! :) __eou__
/away __eou__ Knowing some information about the password can help make recovery possible , but it will only be possible if you chose a particularly weak password also . __eou__
how does this relate to ubuntu __eou__
sir , please pardon my ignorance i am new to linux and ubuntu where can i find the ppa that i need to delete __eou__
Thanks . __eou__
well crap __eou__ any pointers to how I would make some ? __eou__
it is giving size of each of the file recursively , I want only collective size of each folder on my home folder . I don't care about the sizes of files/folders inside the home folders . __eou__
thank you __eou__
sudo echo " ( **unknown** yes) " **unknown** . **unknown** __eou__
Thanks __eou__
i don't know what you need exactly __eou__
ran .. not sure what Im looking for here . __eou__
, ubottu i did correct . thanx for help __eou__
nothing , it shows the " load " screen and when it disappears nothing happens __eou__ i tried running it from terminal , and no output __eou__
sorry , i meant port forwarding setup to ssh to a machine on the network __eou__
TRYING to use edubuntu to teach ESL :) __eou__
I run edubuntu and I'm a teacher ... that said , I teach music ( and have jackd installed ) :) __eou__
The process would eat up almost 100% cpu usage if it was active , but it seems to be inactive . What could I do to check what has happened to the process ? __eou__
Honestly more context is needed . Are you talking about a -web- browser ? If not , are all clients using ubuntu ? __eou__ Aren't there privacy laws against that __eou__ Well if it isn't a web browser they're communicating with your server in , and you don't own the pc your client is using , you're out of luck as far as I know __eou__
sweet , known issue . Real pain __eou__
Ok __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__
I don't think so . I have that disable too :D __eou__
you can use : smbtree __eou__
You're welcome ! __eou__
but what do I do when i need to turn these back on again ? __eou__
can youplease be more specific ? __eou__
you could trying installing ppa-purge and using that from the terminal . __eou__
I did , along with " apt-get clean ; apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ".. Specifically " apt-get install -f " just informs me of some packages which are installed but no longer needed , it doesn't seem to *do* anything __eou__
ok , the expanded paste **unknown** __eou__
not yet , but good idea __eou__
**unknown** **unknown** is SYSV - NOT upstart ! /etc/init/ is upstart . __eou__
I removed the ppa itself using a gui(I'm lazy like that ) called **unknown** . Seems like it 's gone though the packages it 's overwritten are still there __eou__
no need for an option , sudo ppa-purge ppa : **unknown** > __eou__
I want to avoid that because then I am running the vm server and the vm images on the same drive and it bottle necks it ... __eou__ Thank you sec __eou__
I don't have a debian folder though __eou__
you can install tightvnc or other vnc servers , and connect to a ' hidden ' desktop . and login as that user . no need for the more complex x11vnc __eou__ or use ssh/x forwarding to run thunderbird to set it up __eou__
so there is no way to upgrade the package youre sayin ... __eou__
chrome renders java by itself , no need for icedtea __eou__
so you are on a raid ..., that 's differnt __eou__
Tried using another kernel ? __eou__
dunno , I just wanted to use the " fancy " desktop cube and rotate functions __eou__
I have downloaded Ubuntu 12 image ( 32 Bit ) , but a friend of mine is saying that 64 bit is better , but since Ubuntu 12 64 bit has some bugs he has advised me to download Ubuntu 11.1 version __eou__
I'd say " you're trying ot get me to do your home work for you for extra credit " - that 's what I'd say __eou__ troubleshooting computers and troubleshooting linux are nothing like the same so have no relevence __eou__ compiling the kernel is an advacned topic - so I suggest you not attempt it at this time , more so as you're struggling to grasp the fundementals listed on the introduction page __eou__ because you go the kernel from kernel.org __eou__
no idea __eou__
I just used some other source to install some packages ... the version mismatch is very small ... __eou__
thx ... that worked ! __eou__
heh __eou__
thanks I read everything and - it works as long as someone logged in to the machine I'd like to control . But if only lightdm is " logged in " **unknown** X on : 0 , then the connection fails ... __eou__
thats enough . __eou__
unity2d is a dead project 12.10 won't have it ... __eou__
I think I read somewhere that they wont release drivers for it anymore __eou__
I'm on a Late 2007 MacBook right now __eou__
what is meant with interpretation of backslash escapes ? __eou__
Apologies on lag . It seems the module responsible ( usbcore ) is now compiled into the kernel and it nis not possible to reload it on the fly with new parameters . You can however still set it not to suspend by adding **unknown** = -1 into the /etc/sysctl . conf where it will take effect next boot . __eou__
I read that one , will try again I guess __eou__
read all the links . __eou__
yeah exactly that one . it won't work . you can install that version from command line though : " sudo apt-get install fglrx-updates " __eou__ non-post-update version does install with additional drivers , but if you're not afraid of that one apt line , install newer ones ^^ __eou__
It does . Nice thing for watching fullscreen youtube on low ends like netbooks . __eou__
I know I don't have to in order for functionality . But I have to because thats what my assignment is __eou__
this channel is just for support issues __eou__

ubottu : thanks . __eou__
yes it 's a cli utlity , but works well __eou__
What command do I need to run after the chroot ? __eou__
Stands for Traffic Control , part of iproute package __eou__
**unknown** - I am very sorry . I need to run for a while :( __eou__
you can try " dmesg | less " and then hit the space bar to go through page at a time __eou__ less command and it will search for dev/sdb6 one occurence at a time . Hit / again to search for the next occurrence __eou__
is there anything i can do in the mean time ? perform a disk check maybe ? __eou__
I don't __eou__ http://askubuntu.com/questions/27381/how-to-edit-pdf-metadata-from-command-line is probably enough for you , but I'd be willing to bet there 's a nicer way to do it with your scanning software 's configuration __eou__
i am thinking the same :) __eou__
sorry , i don't use upnp . good luck . __eou__
sorry , i was making the point that if you gave a brief overview here then people know what problem you are linking to __eou__ they would be more likely to look at your link then __eou__
#ubuntu-unity may be of more help , and technically they are not ads but search results . anyway , #ubuntu-unity __eou__

Alright , I'll try re-installing then __eou__ though I don't remember it asking me that __eou__ do you know how I can check if the 32-bit compat binaries are already installed ? __eou__
that is the whole point in atopsar . sar is global load . atopsar shows actual processes __eou__
aaahh .. k series .. fudge __eou__
did **unknown** xset q **unknown** not show anything interesting regarding power-saving features or screensavers ? __eou__

Thanks ! I will try that __eou__ Works perfectly ! Thanks again ! __eou__
only with one of the buttons __eou__
**unknown** intended for tablets ...? __eou__
its a 3rd party fork . when the main devs get bored with it . it could die off very fast . Ive seen many other projects die off . Like the ' keep kde3 alive project ' or some other projects ive seen over the last decade . __eou__

after spending a grand on an ultrabook i dont want a junky usb dongle hanging out __eou__

why , is it prone to fail ? __eou__
whats the package name exactly __eou__
the processing file has no extension- it 's just " processing "? __eou__
yes sir . __eou__
why cant you edit files on your computer and push them to the remote machine fi thats where you want them __eou__ just edit them in windows and upload them to the server . Bluefish has a windows client if you need to do that __eou__ or learn vim , it 's pretty useful __eou__
Please try it explicitly , if for nothing else than to make me happy :) __eou__ That means that your boot firmware can boot via either UEFI or BIOS . __eou__ I need to leave , but I will be back in 30-45 minutes . __eou__
ahh , ok __eou__
I think you enable both . __eou__ and it plays , then loops .. forever and ever and ever ... __eou__
wouldn't be the first stupid mistake ive made __eou__ so what editor do you use locall ? __eou__
there should be button on the top left . if not , try asking in #freenode __eou__

mac os x __eou__
thanks buddy ... just realized im on ubuntu channel __eou__
well .. I don't know what else you also blacklisted :\ __eou__
i have , there isn't anything about hidden files in there __eou__
Thank you . __eou__
This is clearly a mint question but lets assume you are right and it is a general linux question you can try ##linux . This channel is for Ubuntu support . Thank you . __eou__
well personally I just use 2 drives but I have done several wubi installs and they work fine __eou__
looks like it wanted to install libpam-smbpass __eou__
Ah , maybe that 's why __eou__ I tried installing gtkpod to help , but to no available __eou__
just make sure you google and man your questions before you ask :) __eou__
gnea : why ! Apache __eou__ its odd ... like everyone seems to follow the rule of repeating their document root in the directory section ... but i don't really get it . __eou__
OK , downloading Wubi __eou__ I don't have to erase any of what 's already on my PC 's boot drive , do I ? __eou__ I like the hard drive solution . Part of what I'm testing is its speed . __eou__
i want the files to have the same name in /tmp/txt directory __eou__
like when you start ubuntu , it gives the list of OS that you have installed in your Pc . Is there any way to edit those __eou__
if you have a spare drive , just install and use it . If you need to re-partition , it can be a little more complex __eou__
nameserver < ip > __eou__
you need to include ". dump " as the second argument __eou__
totally cofused by your post .. trying to sort it out __eou__
I cannot get to that stage because I cannot install it __eou__
and you get me highlighted with ! ops ! __eou__

**unknown** . tgz , I tried installing via PPA , and it installed it to my /usr/bin folder and I couldnt really use it , **unknown** , advice I should remove the package and install that . tar . gz from androids website , I did do that , but do not know how to install it since it is a . tgz file __eou__
yes __eou__
why ? its goign to tell me what its going to remove __eou__
so , uhh , if you'll forgive my noobness , how should i proceed : S __eou__
Ummmm .... I didn't quite get that ? __eou__ I only want to be able to edit/modify/update /var/www without sudo , my research led me to believe symlinks were the best option , but they're not working , not sure where to go . __eou__
did it work ? __eou__
if you can figure out how to uninstall all that other crap .. this command should do exactly what you want ... http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1884720 __eou__

idk , i don't use xen . but those grub-files aren't the reason for that error , for sure __eou__
ya im right there with you . lock into kickstart and ghost like softwares __eou__ sata to usb ftw __eou__

i agree ! __eou__
kk thx __eou__
guess nobody ever tried what you want to do , you're on the way of becoming the expert __eou__
In which case , as " **unknown** " literally replaces them , I don't think you can delete them from the client side __eou__
No , my computer at work runs in gnome and has the **unknown** __eou__
you probably can't do anything about the directory problem __eou__

and where do i do that ? __eou__ i'm in cli only __eou__
http://pastebin.com/AaiRtfrM __eou__ http://pastebin.com/AaiRtfrM __eou__ the same happens with putty under windows , but much less log data __eou__ thanks for remaining completely inert ! I wouldn't have solved it otherwise __eou__
whats the exact path/filename ? im not clear on which conf files you mean __eou__ how i normally think it works . the various parts ' in order ' basically get used as the whole config file . __eou__
Still the same ? What do you mean ? __eou__
ker-ching :p __eou__
no process found __eou__
that bug describes they can still connect successfully __eou__
wouldnt we all ? :P __eou__ Yeah , the chroot/virtual is never as good __eou__
ah , yeah . __eou__
Tried that multiple flavors from net install to mini . Still no dice . __eou__
thanks for that , much appreciated __eou__ so **unknown** **unknown** s is 395 minutes , and **unknown** seconds ? or 6 seconds . 208 ms ? __eou__
OK , so , get a free Amazon Web Services virtual server instance ( minimal profile) , install openvpn into it . Configure it and your PC to use openvpn to create an IP tunnel ( " tun " not " tap " interface) , configure the AWS instance for IP masquerading , and set a route on your local PC that sends all traffic for the US sites via the tunnel . That way , the destination site sees a US-based public IP address accessing it . __eou__
this is the uni 's network , can't change them __eou__
that 's why " recovery " mode would be beneficial . __eou__
ok , a gui would probably help me . :) __eou__
depends how you installed it from source __eou__
website isn't really file hosting , do you want a web server or a file server __eou__
so ? __eou__ he can tell you what type of encyption he used . __eou__ ok - then that 's not an " ubuntu " problem __eou__
blueman , for manager __eou__
i don't understand why I need to wait __eou__
jordan , compdoc , I don't have my own server , a friend of mine uses openvpn for windows and it has a interface and connect to vpn server I guess that it owned by Openvpn . org people , can I do something smiler in ubuntu ? __eou__
Yes but i plan on putting all of the make imgs on rasppi sd card __eou__ I took the template folder where i was trying to create the make file and copied it to the GNU tools location ... different error now __eou__

a lot of choices when searching term " proxy " , any suggestion ? __eou__
you write it , i believe there is an example included in /usr/share/doc/openvpn/ __eou__
compiling is always safe . __eou__
oh ty __eou__
OK . did you see http://www.openprinting.org/printer/HP/HP-LaserJet_1018 and downloaded the firmware to the printer after each printer restart __eou__ could be you need **unknown** rights to do that __eou__ sorry I was away did you get that printer up working again ? __eou__
.. use it if youwant .. was kidding of course __eou__
Oh , right , thanks . __eou__
did you find out anything ? __eou__
So would you mind to share that link again ? __eou__
yes but linux is just kernel , userspace is gnu __eou__
not sure , did you try to install with ubuntu livecd ? __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
pm is fine __eou__
cool __eou__
yeah but I wasn't sure where to start ! can you recommend one ? __eou__ ah thank you ! I will try there ! __eou__

sorry if this has been asked already : do you use ntp time server or ntpdate as a command ? __eou__
lucid supports it __eou__ 10.04 uses 2.6 . 32 so its supported until 10.04 is eol __eou__
but if is memory , how do I fix it ? __eou__
there are hundrets and i can't kill them fast enough :D __eou__
I suggest you stop your ntpd for a moment , then use ntpdate to jump to the correct time and then restart ntpd __eou__ no , it is the other way round : you cannot use ntpdate while ntpd is running __eou__ listen to KM0201 __eou__
yes __eou__
in what way ? This method works on other distros , so I'm wondering what would be causing my problem on ubuntu . __eou__ do you have any suggestions ? because I can't manually edit sudoers through visudo on every machine . __eou__
good :) __eou__
yes , I was going to tell I'm on wubi __eou__ yes , I was going to tell I'm on wubi __eou__
Hey , no I'm not sure how to do that __eou__
200GB = 200*1024*1024 MB = **unknown** ) Byte = **unknown** ) Bit ... __eou__ And 128 kBps = 128*1024 Bit per second . __eou__
i'll give a try __eou__

only when you know what to man __eou__ almost always when I come to IRC , I'm just looking for the word to toss into google __eou__

right , disper is the only thing I know about . I think you can pass something like -- **unknown** to nvidia-settings ( and you could create the config file by saving your settings after using the gui one time) . But I've never used nvidia-settings this way and I've only used disper to do something very simple __eou__
is it viable to use FAT as extended for storage ? or is there a security risk if its not a native linux partition ? __eou__
lspci just shows that the hardware exists , but it doesn't mean the OS knows anything about it . you need to load the drivers __eou__
do one thing , type jocke in terminal and then press tab , you'll get all the available options . __eou__ mine is jockey-kde , yours must me something similar __eou__

wired connection hooked in .... but unable to get Internet __eou__ k __eou__
**unknown** , it is online but i dont think you would be able to access it because you have to be logged into my school account . __eou__ yes it is in the firefox browser still __eou__ it just says loading module but it never does anything after that . __eou__
Thank you mget worked like a charm :) problem solved __eou__
if you just want to " try " and you intend to overwrite your current install , I do insist just trying the ' xubuntu-desktop ' - it will take a lot less time __eou__
you can make it log the output by sending it into a file ' cp -arv /mydir > **unknown** . log ' __eou__ though in reality , the problem will likely occur when it stops xD __eou__ you should benchmark a simple html only file and use that for latency test , then you can watch top to see how hard which processes are working when trying to load a drupal page __eou__ drupal is pretty heavy , it could just be processing time on a machine not optimized for web serving on a large scale ? __eou__ case close __eou__

I just want to boot an installer ( the mini . iso , to be particular) , from a 32 GB USB flash drive . __eou__

the command would be " which adb " i see im late in giving that answer __eou__
Yes . No need to ask me , at least . ( I've never understood why someone would want to spam a public channel with what 's effectively a private message . ) __eou__
all right , figured that might be the case -- thanks __eou__ If I choose that option , is it still possible to make it use LVM / crypto ? __eou__
default Unity . __eou__ every time I get on the computer . __eou__ At first I can see the messages indicator and can click on it . __eou__ And I can see the dropdown . __eou__ But then it disappears . __eou__ Shrinks to 1px . __eou__

i know , but i wouldn't have gone to all this trouble if i didn't see in windows 7 the better looking resolution 1024x768 : -s __eou__ just to be sure , and have a prt screen :) i'll install win7 again this afternoon oke ? __eou__ and i'll install the driver ( since there is a specific one in windows ) .. and if win7 does it , i'm sure ubuntu has to be able to also do this __eou__
my screen is wide ... and with 600 , it looks odd ... __eou__ i thought that this tutorial is what i need :) __eou__ in the sample i get like : Screen 0 : minimum 320 x 200 , current 1024 x 600 , maximum 1800x1800 __eou__ so shouldn ; t it be able to go higher than 600 ... and i remember that on windows it did , but to be sure i have to reinstall it one more time and then get back to ubuntu :D __eou__ not right now , i have to get home from work in about 5 hours or so , i dont have the netbook with me . __eou__ will you be online in like 5 hours or so ? __eou__ oke , thank you ... i'll check on windows what we talked here and get back to ubuntu __eou__ i wanna be sure , and take a screenshot even , that windows sets the resolution to 1024x768 ... if that 's the case , ubuntu has to be able to do that so .. ( as far as i can remember , windows did that , but not really sure) , so i have to make this " experiment " __eou__ oke , ty __eou__ =) ) wow , sry __eou__ that thank you is also for you __eou__
to be sure of that you have to read the documentation for the driver __eou__
hrm __eou__ don't know exactly where to go next __eou__ Dude , I'd probably recommend that you'd just reinstall since it'd be easier than tracking ghosts __eou__

10.10 is eol . it may be yourchipset is not supported by the older drivers __eou__
I did . /configure .. and I got that error ? __eou__
yes but it will always take that lon . I have installed gentoo before __eou__ install a new release of Ubuntu and the updates will be fewer , taking less time to get the latest packages , that 's my point __eou__
what 's the command ? __eou__
which bit ? __eou__
the main concern with zykotick9 's suggestion would be stability if you are using any proprietary drivers __eou__ there are a bunch of ways to do it . its really up to you . running another X server on a different tty , using xnest , using vnc , ssh back to localhost __eou__
Ringtail is 13.04 __eou__ ;) __eou__ didn't say anything was wrong with it __eou__ the gnome team have dropped it and are focussing on gnome3 __eou__ ALT+F2 opens dialogue similar to the the run dialogue in windows __eou__

i am trying to find them __eou__
according to **unknown** copying . iso is what I should do in order to get bootable USB stick __eou__
you can't make bootable systems like that . __eou__ there should be instructions on ubuntu.com on how to create a bootable USB from windows __eou__
you can use ccsm , myunity or ubuntu-tweak to change stuff __eou__ yes , ubuntu-tweak is 3rd party so you'll need a ppa __eou__ log off and select the Ubuntu session in lightdm __eou__
It suddenly stopped . __eou__
Thank you __eou__

I mean that can we install a software so that I can use terminal flexibly ... In case of linux mint I had installed " vim " __eou__

your USB stick could need formating becuz of corruption inside on some of it 's hidden system files __eou__
It may only work on " Classic " desktop tho .. i'm not sure which one you were using . __eou__
I just opened FF and tried that key combo , to see if it worked the first time , you can move the tabs around by dragging I believe . __eou__
that 's what I've done , then I clicked on properties of the package , and from there I could see this file list , but I don't see what is the lib path ? As there are many different ones . __eou__ I'm not even sure it 's this package , I can also see a libfreetype6-dev package , I've installed it to , but for this one too there is a lot of files __eou__
memory = ram , i think you mean harddisk space __eou__
ask in #launchpad __eou__

right , but you've seen how trivially easy that is to break __eou__
Much thanks __eou__
openssh is free software from OpenBSD . so being BSD licenses i guess a closed version could exist ( i can't figure out why anyone would pay for a closed source SSH but whatever ) __eou__
thanks __eou__
your issue is likely because you had the -updates repository enabled at some point , updated , and now you've disabled it . The easiest solution is to just enable -updates again __eou__
during the installation wizard , you can select where to install ubuntu __eou__ my bad i misread that , you had already installed it __eou__ you can't; you can either run through the instlalation all over again on the other disk , or just move all the files over ( thought he latter is a bit mroe complicated ) __eou__ I think you will still need to update your current grub install to let it know there is a second ubuntu install on the other disk __eou__ also if you add a new grub install to the other disk , whichever disk is booted to first in the bios will have the grub that needs to be updated __eou__
glad you got what you needed - have fun with ubuntu :) __eou__
as I said I have very limited experience in this realm , but I thought that xvnc doesn't even need a local video card __eou__
did you not sudo ? __eou__ " sudo umount dev/<your device here > " would be run from a terminal . __eou__ *sudo umount /dev/<your device > " __eou__ Ah . In that case , you may have to do this all from an account that isn't depending on it as a home folder . The only other option would be to unmount with the -l flag , and I think that would cause problems here . __eou__
yeah im sorry im taking so long too , this isn't something we often do http://www.howtogeek.com/116409/how-to-turn-your-ubuntu-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/ take a look at that __eou__

Does it get reset at boot , or only after login ? __eou__
xrandr just gives me an error : `can't open display ' __eou__

hmm , seems more of a graphics issue __eou__ which version of Ubuntu are you running ? __eou__ I don't know that I can be of any help but like jagginess suggested you could install synaptic ( package manager ) and use that for now and report a bug against software center using in terminal : ubuntu-bug software-center __eou__

https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution #This site looks interesting . __eou__ Yea , from there , you should be able to figure out a suitable command to output to the other monitor . __eou__ xrandr | pastebinit __eou__ If I can see what you see , maybe I can figure it out . __eou__
boot signature = 2 __eou__ Your coments ( and mine as of late) , are OT and should be discussed in #ubuntu-offtopic . Sorry to correct you but , just stating the facts . __eou__
so there is by default a separate partition ? __eou__
What exactly are you trying to accomplish . ( Maybe we can help you if you tell us what exactly you are trying to do . ) __eou__
Good . Now " modinfo nvidia " ? __eou__
wait to give you the output when iam trying to do thid __eou__
ok , great . Do you know what dir they are in ? __eou__
The DHCP client configuration is exactly the same using the server edition . So obviously your ISP doesnt offer a hostname using DHCP . __eou__

Thanks . All of this shows that your wireless card is currently using the default Linux drivers that are supposed to support it . Have you tried using those ? __eou__ Either way , if you are going to use ndiswrapper with the wireless card , you will need to stop those drivers from using the card . __eou__
KDE makes it REAL simple ... __eou__

the conversation is long past its sell by date . lets move on __eou__
Hows it going ? __eou__
gparted doesn't support lvm , and it is not a syntax error __eou__
i think i got it running once i plugged in an ethernet cable and turned eth0 off via ifdown . as soon as i plug the cable in , the wlan module can be turned on and off via the hardware key ... __eou__
haha , thanks I just found it as you typed that . Thanks againg __eou__
No you can have both it is what you put in the mbr burg or grub that will be the bootloader , burg needs a few files installed so be careful to do it right and know how to load the mbr . __eou__
sshfs ??? what is that ? i just ssh into the box . sudo nautilis find the file and double click , it starts movie player but i cant seek __eou__ is that all you do ? __eou__
ok ill install unity then ;) __eou__
have you ever been able to get into ur desktop ? __eou__
I have used it not worth the hassle even if you know all the tricks really at least for me . __eou__
yes __eou__
No . I don't think so __eou__
You may want to look into a distro called crunchbang if you are tired of unity too . __eou__
find the pid and kill it . It will be threaded for sure . ps ax | grep -v grep | grep pulse __eou__
: yes __eou__
Cool , I'm just really careful not to brick another 's computer is all . __eou__
it is possible whatever video driver it is using has a corrupted configuration , the device file is corrupted , or the driver is not installed . Try re-installing the guest extensions . __eou__
Likely , the package needs to be modified . You may try downloading the package from packages.ubuntu.com , but install with care . man dpkg , search " dry run ". __eou__
you running the 64 bit __eou__ Ah good the easiest way would be a lighter desktop probably there is xubuntu and lubuntu , lubuntu runs lightest of these . __eou__ I have a lesser dual core and 2 gigs ram and am running 32 bit it runs quite fast . __eou__
my problem is that when I installed metasploit , it came with its own postgresql installation __eou__
nah , ill use wine for that __eou__
I don't know what that is . Is there any simple program for a dummy ? __eou__
I don't think there is a root password __eou__
then by all means , throw a wrench into it ! :) __eou__
what 's the command for it ? __eou__
desktop . __eou__ Thank you , I'll check that . __eou__ I'll check with that , somsip . Thank you . __eou__ Well , somsip , Initially , after an upgrade **unknown** 3.4 had a few bugs like the libnotify didn't show up any text , so I decided to downgrade it , but I had a few problems so I decided to uninstall gnome-shell completely and re-installing it via gnome-fallback . __eou__ But apparently , now that I try to do it , it shows up broken packages that need to be resolved prior to an installation , **unknown** . __eou__ * somsip __eou__
I see it doesn't have " execute " checked .... it needs that one ? __eou__
MorpheusChalice try : sudo apt-get purge gnome-shell ; sudo apt-get clean ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install gnome-shell __eou__
it also lists for quantal , but my keyboard is dieing so I'm giving up __eou__
is this part of an upgrade ? __eou__ so you're moving to the 12.10 platform ? __eou__
I told you , I'm not interested , someone else will help you __eou__ that language is unacceptable __eou__ I asked you for information , you did something else , you wasted my time so I don't want to progress it , I'm sure someone else will __eou__

and you are not supposed to do that __eou__
ethernet ? im on wireless connection __eou__
i'm only after a tool which does that , not to make one myself __eou__
In that case , it looks like the ubuntu partition is *not* still there __eou__
i understand : -s ... on previous ubuntu it worked oke , but on Lubuntu , it started with no sound __eou__
Do you mind if I help you in a /pm or in #bash ? I don't want to spam this channel with non-ubuntu stuff __eou__
when we install XP in a system it eats up everything .. the ubuntu partition is still there but no bootloader to access it __eou__
heard of 3D games ? __eou__
thanks :) __eou__

Ah , well , you can always upload the file to google-drive or something . but I don't know of any simple way to do it __eou__ Of coruse , there is having a server you contorl and using NFS __eou__ or ftp , etc , but that is more involved __eou__ ^ __eou__ But if you want a NFS or something you just can mount and use , I suggest a VPS or a home server . __eou__
mount /dev/sdb3 **unknown** **unknown** type file system ' **unknown** ' __eou__
fine . __eou__ **unknown** , does it make a difference if the maintainer is from debian ? The straight backport package build+installed 100% . Without microcode AMD systems are unstable . __eou__
i can count too __eou__
if you use firefox , just use the noscript addon , and only allow scripts from sites you trust , you will be fine __eou__
well I dont know where it is and it is complete and looks like a normal operation __eou__ Ill find it .. ok and thx __eou__
you can delete the client and use just the web interface __eou__ or you can configure the **unknown** ) to sync only exect folders __eou__
LOL , it was apropos to **unknown** looks like Compiz is just a troublemaker __eou__
never noticed . id have to say check the grub2 docs .. it may be telling grub to sacn all the disks for their uuids __eou__
BaldFat : Success ! Running xfwm4 -- replace replaces compiz with the functional xfwm4 , XFCE 's default window manager __eou__ BaldFat : So now , how to make sure compiz does not start on boot , but rather xfwm ? __eou__ How can I make sure my system boots into XFWM rather than compiz now ? __eou__
Yes , you have to press and *hold* it to show the shortcuts __eou__
it says it 's already installed , but nothing on boot right now . it just has the ubuntu splash with the row of dots __eou__
**unknown** < -- **unknown** __eou__ ( sorry ) __eou__
first upgrade , then ask again __eou__
Thanks . How would one know of that link after downloading from http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop ? __eou__
Yeah , but you can't do a kernel update . ( well , you can but you'd have to update it manually . ) __eou__
Thanks , but that wasn't the question :) __eou__
i had a laptop that inverted the image . :) __eou__
thanks , everything works great now , event the icon in bar :) thank you __eou__
paste the error message *verbatim* __eou__
Still , this is the best place for support __eou__
is there nothing i can try ? __eou__
" current stable " = debian 6 ? __eou__
xdg-user-dirs package is responsible for it and you can control its behavior with **unknown** . conf . I don't know if debian installs it by default or not __eou__
zzz dont compare it to windows you will have a head ache __eou__ that is no good , since ubuntu does not take of a space , it will just be a **unknown** __eou__ try doing 2 or 3 partition __eou__
Anti-virus , networking managering support software , remote desktop connection , etc . __eou__
Oh right , because I just wanted to know if I could use it or not . __eou__
im not that experienced in ubuntu either , rather a newbie as well :P __eou__
wine/playonlinux have their own folders , normally /home/username/ . wine __eou__ you could do some symbolic links to trick it tho __eou__
what do you mean ? __eou__ ah , yes im in the wrong channel . __eou__
Respite 's ;) he wanted to download sth to a specific drive , not download a drive =) __eou__
sry ty~ __eou__
you can do stuff in liveCD/USB then __eou__ its in use so you wont . liveCD will free the device __eou__
you want to avoid a diserto that customuzes things to the proper language ? __eou__
Ok =-) __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
download a drive ??? __eou__ a drive is a disk ? __eou__ well a . ) you don't use antivirus the same as windows - you certainly don't download a windows question __eou__
error is simple , just " backup failed : error code 500 ". ( which I am guessing is just http 500 for non-specific server error) . Thanks , i will try #ubuntuone too . But I thought it might be a problem with deja-dup ... __eou__
they are best avoided , there is a doc on hybrid graphics , you may be able to turn one off . They are simply best avoided __eou__
well long story short : i have to activate the device with " sudo ifconfig wlan0 up " and restart the network manager each time I restart the notebook , otherwise it wont work :/ __eou__
No . __eou__
was tryign to run it without display but obv that is not possible __eou__
my mistake ! I am on 12.04 ... when I wrote 12.10 it was just a mental slip . I have never run future versions . __eou__
WHAT THE FUCK ?! __eou__
whats guake ? __eou__
unlikely as i am running vnc __eou__
thnx . i'll check it . __eou__
ok i did now ? __eou__
well funny story , i was trying to use tranmission but i can't find the web ui __eou__ i think it 's because i have an outdated ver of ubuntu __eou__ but funnily i try to update and it gives me an error i don't understand because i am not familiar with using the command line updater __eou__ so i thought i would use the graphical one via vnc __eou__
Under windows device manager says intel ( r ) hd graphic family , as I said Interl variant , any help is appreciated __eou__ that not enough ? __eou__
well , yeah , i didn't say it 's expensive , but about a yeah ago i had a pc with 2gb ram and i was able to play the newest computer games , and it did't lag ... i was able to run game servers and a web server too ... __eou__
Unfortunately that key combo doesn't seem to do anything for me . __eou__

i know that , i'm only asking if it 's a known ubuntu problem or just zentyal **unknown** __eou__
ah right __eou__ ! samba | hannah_irina __eou__ ignore the windows part , look it up for some guides etc . __eou__
Which command ? __eou__
just asking is all , bluetooth can be problematic in ubuntu I have found myself , this may not be the same for everyone though . __eou__ /etc/default/grub is the file for adding parameters once added run a update-grub __eou__
the dash ? if you mean the unity starter - it doesnt pop up __eou__ also the windows keys do nothing __eou__
Is it a wireless printer ? That was the problem I had , the scanner wasn't recognised wirelessly with the default version __eou__

yes , I dual boot w8 and 12.04 . if you type http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/download __eou__ windows 8 is very fast . I have to admit that : __eou__
that doesn't seem as a solution __eou__
but why i connot to connent with user roto ? __eou__
Well , Oracle did not design the USB images to be used with something else rather than Solaris . __eou__
you need to use gdm to get a working lockscreen with gnome-shell I think ( though it might have gnome-screensaver fallback now , I forget ) __eou__ if lightdm is installed : sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm ; __eou__
What 's dry ? __eou__ Also , do-release-upgrade is not a command . __eou__
I mean , will it still behave the way one would expect ubuntu to **unknown** . __eou__ Thanks . Other people call me crazy for wanting ubuntu in stead of osx ... You at least help me out . :) __eou__ Model id " 11.3 " is not in the list . __eou__ 11 , 3* __eou__

oic ... sweet __eou__ i only know dirty in terms of a buffer that hasn't been written / flushed . if a linux fs had open filehandles , sync () would ensure their buffers are written __eou__ good for cleanly unmounting a system that 's looking fsck'd __eou__

or make wrong settings ( forgot dot or something ) and thats why you dont allow to save __eou__

You were refering to them fighting , catting , no ? I was just overreacting , as a joke . __eou__
interesting idea . i'll keep looking __eou__ i'm not so sure . for instance look at this https://github.com/gplessis/dotdeb-php5/commit/9a5999608ee6b4c62e1ced62c0ecb51098748cab in debian/rules he deliberately fixes the missing pcre support __eou__

Thanks for the conversation , good luck . __eou__
i'm no hardware expert but he is clearly trying to buy something and make sure ubuntu will work with it first __eou__
I'd assume irssi is smarter than that .... __eou__
Do you right click on the folder ? __eou__
i only have 100G HDD space for this OS .. now how much exactly should I give to both /var and /tmp . root also __eou__
hold on there __eou__
sometimes services bind to localhost and won't listen to external addresses , I don't know about seagull __eou__
Doesn't really seem like the right place , but I guess it'll have to do __eou__
but it doesnt automatically download them does it ? __eou__
thank you . __eou__
am trying to connect to a another computer running on linux with ssh installed .. just doing an experiment __eou__
So at least the firmware loaded differs . __eou__
which version of firefox are you using ? __eou__ when i choose proxy , foxyproxy says : Unrecognized mode specified __eou__
or does this mean Mark isn that focused on bringing good software to the 3rd world as he told me in the times of the Hoary Hedgehog ? __eou__
that doesn't impact the function of this channel __eou__
9600M GT __eou__ and I'm using 3.2 . **unknown** __eou__
fuser only tells " it listens " not the ifaces/addresses __eou__ as root " lsof -i : 3868 " please paste the output . " its listening " says nothing __eou__

Last question ; I am not really planning to do desktop use ; I only want to setup LAMP and then varnish / drupal and stuff to experiment .. Should I use Ubuntu or another distribution ? __eou__
I doubt their Linux comitment is very strong , they dumped google linux without any anouncement whatsoever , after all __eou__
: | no __eou__
type /join #ubuntu-offtopic __eou__
thinkt , other distros include it __eou__ msp ok __eou__ think i dont konw but ubuntu is not usa __eou__ so u are saying usa is less free . is that it __eou__ well u said it __eou__ no __eou__ can u install newest google chrome on ubuntu 804 __eou__ ?? __eou__
yes , but not in wubi __eou__ wubi is a pseudo-installation inside windows __eou__ i once asked to add something to the website and they did , maybe you can do it too __eou__ what 's keeping you from doing it ? __eou__
if you dont have the cd , then what did you expect __eou__
http://www.openoffice.org/documentation/setup_guide2/1.1.x/en/SETUP_GUIDE.html or is it something else ? __eou__
so a directory within /home/yourusername then ? __eou__
dont works .. cd is secure . need of cd to install __eou__ Im gonna try with isomount __eou__ dont have this on winehq __eou__ i looked __eou__
then you can mount that disk somewhere and copy files __eou__ and then use the " ln -s " thing or go with the " mount " thing . If you go the " ln -s " thing you must mount the 2nd disk too __eou__
so you agrre __eou__
is that just a name change , or different software ? __eou__
sounds useful __eou__
simply because i'm installing pecl_http and it requires cur **unknown** which is available in either of those two . so it 's a straight choice between them ? __eou__ any follow up ? thanks __eou__

is your network mirror on a local network or public ? __eou__
but i wont install it in a VPS till like jan . __eou__
what is your ubuntu support issue __eou__ ? __eou__
that requires cd < **unknown** , rm -rf < **unknown** will do exactly the same , without the extra command . :/ __eou__
I send you a query on how-to install it __eou__
the openvz kernel dont run right on 11.10 or 10.04 . but it runs good on 12.04 LTS but its a pain to install and get going . __eou__
shouldn't it have fork that ? __eou__ There should be a fork to prevent this kind of translation error in manpages . __eou__
do what bekks said . __eou__ so add the kernel repos . __eou__
screen is broken .. i gives me weird errors about my env __eou__
shutdown -r now __eou__
i already uninstalled it __eou__
Its not supported in here basically :) __eou__ it will set it inside the chroot - on your harddisk . __eou__
tyler_d ok Thanks __eou__
no because it loads my radio server and it takes over the audio with a different source so i cant access the audio like it normally would work so i have a work around by loading failsafe and then it doesnt load the radio station stuff and i can hear audio see ? __eou__
Heh I think we need a bootscript is all . __eou__ heh is a chuckle . __eou__
thats a software part , windows requires a physical slice . iicr __eou__ bekks can help you .. :) __eou__
parent1 exits - so , proc1 reparents to init ( ID 0 ) and still has its language strings for hebraic translation allocated in memory __eou__ If the zombie process has id nnnnn , you can do ps -ef | grep nnnnn and find the id of the parent process , which you can then kill if no longer needed . __eou__
I'm using the ones from kernel.ubuntu.com __eou__
well apt-get -f install is how you fix broken depends . __eou__
which gpu is yours ? __eou__
! attitude | simplew __eou__ furthermore , I don't think it 's a smart idea to encrypt disks *at all* __eou__
I use the daily downloads and rsync until they are released just for ease of travel , I have not had a bad download in years no matter what method , but torrents are supposedly better . __eou__
did it work ? __eou__ its easy ... google for tuts . __eou__
Try #ubuntu+1 and see if they can help you , if not you will have to reinstall what you need , quantal is released in Oct though , you may be okay if it is not your only OS . __eou__ Go to #ubuntu+1 __eou__
im browsing in the link you referred and i cant see the alternate cd __eou__
im using 8.04 for my servers :P __eou__
in theory yes . __eou__
You dont create physical devices . Your harddisk is a physical device , thats all . __eou__ Partitions always are created on physical devices . __eou__
dont expect triviality , you well get further =) __eou__ too much expectancy culture problemb __eou__
Can I PM you ? I dont want to flood this place with usenet chat especially cause my next question to you might be sensitive lol __eou__
yes Im on ubuntu latest one __eou__

as wilee-nilee said , its in beta 2 __eou__ there'll be a release cadidate also I believe , then final __eou__
ok , no not nvidia-current related , ty . __eou__
Okay . It is an OS , it 's just that you can install pantheon-session by itself . So weird that changing the greeter changed grub . Thank you , trying __eou__
i c __eou__ now just wait for things to happen . i read #8 > adding libglib 2.0 -dev to build deps .. __eou__
No . A virtual machine never simulates an OS , but always executes an OS in a virtual machine . __eou__ Thats why a virtualization solution has nothing to do with emulating or simulating an OS . __eou__
thats not exactly helpful but interesting none the less __eou__
YOU can move that sda1 to being inside the extended , by cloning it and removing the sda1 or making it the NTFS with a bootflag and extended the extended to put the sda1 in , but you will have to change the sda1 clone to the partition number it goes to if you use say clonezilla , and the partition in the extended has to be the same size or bigger as the original sda1 . __eou__
Okay I'll take a look . __eou__
ok , i will try , thank you __eou__
Did you use **unknown** ? __eou__
What das " gn " mean ? __eou__
without installing anything after the initial install ? __eou__
I apoligize , I suppose that would have been useful information to state . __eou__
if you have access to a live cd __eou__

sure ! I have plenty of 2TB+ servers sitting around ! Let me take out my creditcard and pay for another **unknown** box ... __eou__
does it need to be in my /var/www dir ? __eou__
ahhh that 's another story :-) __eou__
I take it that this should be fairly obvious =) I have an unnatural fear of xorg . conf __eou__
how can you say I doubt I would know either ? and how can you expect people to advise you if an upgrade will fix your problems with no information about why these applications are crashing __eou__
So what do you mean by " in flight "? __eou__
yeah i also tought about that . I really don't want to have not needed writes to my SSD ; however it would be cool do have knowledge of what an executable is really doing with the files , if it 's reading or writing something . __eou__
that is not the same as nvidia current or is it ? __eou__
so i have to change both ? __eou__ dirty ratio is now set to 10 ... it means it 's using 1.6 GB of RAM before committing writes to the HDDs ? __eou__
ya . iso is easy ;) cat can do it . __eou__
any ideas ? __eou__
because the files do not exist on that server - if you check them manually you will see they are not there , so therefore how can you expect ubuntu to update from a server without the files being on the server __eou__
the sections on ' Alias ' and ' DocumentRoot ' in the Apache docs . __eou__
log a securirty bug __eou__
have you read the long thread about this ; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/999910 __eou__
why do you write the question mark out , with a space like that . is that correct grammer ? __eou__
is it normal that modprobe -r usbhid hangs the USB controller ? __eou__
that 's what it is mate __eou__ avrdude can communicate directly over the parallel port with an AVR chip to program it __eou__
thx __eou__
I'm running 12.04 LTS , using virsh and deployed the VMs with ubuntu-vm-builder .. __eou__

are you bot ? __eou__
I don't want to create a package , I want to compile a patched package for xorg so that my drawing tablet works properly . __eou__
no , i don't have this __eou__
good to know . just like to know what works so I can pass it on to the next person . best of luck ! __eou__
i am good , i was kinda hoping i could be of some service . thanks though __eou__
no __eou__
Personally I would not know . __eou__
the problem is this isn't working . its still booting to gnome-classic when I hve the user set to ' Automatic Login ' __eou__
welcome . I forget the system but it seems like one I used had speeds reversed . __eou__
do you know what i'm talking about ? __eou__ see this for an example http://pastebin.com/XEQ93YUe __eou__ personally , i ditched mainline ubuntu for xubuntu since the gnome3 / unity bs __eou__
what do you mean ? __eou__
how so ? __eou__
i'm done feeding trolls . i'm too tired to care __eou__
you are an idiot __eou__
Just commenting .. don't need help __eou__
dbz was first aired some years ago :P but that is stuff to be discussed in the ot-channel ;) __eou__
Ok one sec __eou__
no __eou__ it is the ubuntu full disk encryption __eou__
server i386 __eou__
it is typing-in-lots-of-channels syndrome __eou__
aha :) __eou__
man that stinks ! __eou__
how many lines of text am i allowed to type at one time ? __eou__

ahh okay __eou__
google is a CIA front . __eou__
#httpd is a freenode channel __eou__
good question , please stand by __eou__ possibly http://www.upubuntu.com/2011/07/how-to-check-your-opengl-and-nvidia.html __eou__
thanks for the referral to #pulseaudio but they seem to be too uptight in there to be bothered to answer my question __eou__
have already increased from 8.10 to 9.10 __eou__
my sources . list deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ karmic main universe restricted multiverse and moore __eou__ to 9.10 to 10 . * __eou__
no prob . althoug , i am not sure it was a bug . nevertheless , i hope you enjoy 12.04 :) __eou__
yes __eou__ what i need is a real time simple port monitor that will deposit its output to a standard out txt file . I want to run two instance of the script to monitor two ports since i need both feeds __eou__
basically what I am trying to do is run that in a screen . my current command has been cd /usr/local/minecraft/ and then . **unknown** __eou__ but I want to make an alias of that __eou__ would I have to put the CD part into the screen command itself ? __eou__
maybe first uninstall the previously installed one __eou__
And is stored in files . The above applies . __eou__
thank you **unknown** __eou__
yea if you can't use a simple tool like scanmodem __eou__ I set up a modem years ago its a non issue __eou__
ive tried it with vlc and vlc even doesnt start the file ... i think the file is broken but is there a " workaround " maybe ? __eou__
ohh ... :) nope , it is something that controls the monitor on/off and saves some battery . try executing ' xset -q ' on your machine , you'll see a dpms at the end , thats the energy star __eou__
all the statusbar icons by default are monochrome ... lol __eou__
is is sufficient to just set the entire www directory and subfiles/directories to 775 ? __eou__
It 's a server with a ION chip embedded __eou__ Strange thing though ... " lm_sensors " is reporting that high is +100 and crit is **unknown** ... shouldn't crit be above " high " ? __eou__
i see .... too bad , my wallpaper looks a bit squashed :) __eou__
*-display description : VGA compatible controller product : Wrestler [ Radeon HD 6290 ] vendor : **unknown** Semiconductor ( **unknown** Electronics ) __eou__ from monitor/display settings , 1024x600 is the highest , but I KNOW i've seen higher .. but i'm kinda new to the whole ubuntu thing , and i need guidance __eou__
First , determine what is in use now __eou__
ok i'll check that thanks __eou__
wait I ll log out to see what ll happen now __eou__
did you try the wiki ? __eou__ probably , but come to a forum or irc **unknown** to ask __eou__
in practical terms __eou__
ask in ##hardware __eou__
Yeah , that is definitely not supported in here __eou__
On amd64 : " **unknown** . so . 22 " __eou__
I was going to . It 's for charity . But first I want a stable system __eou__
64bit __eou__
you do have some idea how ' awsome ' works ? its not for the normal beginner . __eou__ the lightdm login screen when you first login ... __eou__
i unziped the file using " unzip file . zip " , went to the directory and ran . **unknown** and thats what it shows __eou__
sandb____ hte problem there is that you haven't specified a port other than " localhost "... you need to tell it what port to try on localhost to hit the tunnel __eou__
then run ls -lha to see wether the file actually exists with that name . __eou__
i did it with guayadeque __eou__
thank you . __eou__
So I just put that command in /etc/rc . local ? __eou__
i agree , but on my ubuntu it s not the case :/ __eou__
MonkeyDust some games , mainly , so i seek performance __eou__
telnet isnt running . __eou__
bazhang , with full performance ? Because unity is a compiz plugin ... __eou__
yea , so I guess the alternate has no X support at all __eou__
that does work however does not achieve the desired kernel upgrade __eou__
my usb 3.0 port runs like a usb 2.0 __eou__ no usb 3.0 devices can run on this port __eou__
I think theadmin already helped me out by pointing out this one " sudo apt-get install fglrx-amdcccle " __eou__
thanks !! is this for prolonging the use of ffmpeg ? __eou__
you don't need that specific driver , as that 's for windows __eou__
It worked , thanks ! __eou__
But I'm starting to feel like the annoying noob :p __eou__
good start is https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting __eou__
users run commands from here , running that command is highly destructive __eou__
Yeah , like I just told actionParsnip , it 's confusing when you have titles like " Installing Gnome 3 on Ubuntu 12.04 ( Precise Pangolin ) " __eou__
the USB kernel developers are actively working on it , from what I see __eou__
thats why i told him he could repair the bootloader . __eou__
yea 4gb only __eou__
why not simply use a bash script and add it to your cron ? __eou__
im looking for ANYONE for help . __eou__
stop stealing my typos :p __eou__ I have this on one of my servers : " eddie jeeves= /sbin/shutdown , /sbin/ifup , /sbin/ifconfig , /sbin/ip , /usr/sbin/service " __eou__
i have a bad habit of adding ' s ' to directory .. causes me tons of problems when i do my systems :( __eou__
you can add the PPA by installing : http://archive.getdeb.net/install_deb/playdeb_0.3-1~getdeb1_all.deb __eou__ you can then use the links on the playdeb site to install apps easily __eou__ The Penumbra series is very worth the cash , as are the humble bundles :) __eou__
thank you very much :D __eou__
you can tab complete service names , so type l and then hit TAB __eou__
what random forum posters say doesn't really dictate how i maintain a Debian system :) __eou__
Geforce 7025/nForce 630a __eou__
just chrome __eou__
i have tried , doesnt work . I think ti must not support it . I have searched to no avail __eou__
that is the problem i usually uninstall the old as soon as i get the new one . I know better now __eou__
newly installed stuff does not show __eou__ like with ' killall gnome-panel ' and then the service restarts the applets and menus itself __eou__
sudo apt-get install bootchart , after that reboot the system __eou__ log image will be placed in var/log/bootchart __eou__
chioo ?? __eou__
why avoid wubi ? __eou__
i tried but i will tried it a secound time . p.s. soon back __eou__ i can only activate the first one but not the upadtes drivers . blender is still not running . :[ __eou__ when i try to start a program which includes any 3d nothing happens . __eou__
no problem , thanks for helping . :D __eou__
i setup my online account and that is MSN . when i start empathy it shows , displays the contact **unknown** second and exits withouth anything . __eou__
come to think of it , what do you mean by a+i mux __eou__ urm .. well .. I have dual 7850 's running on the desktop __eou__ and intel/nvidia hotswap on laptop __eou__
no idea sorry , i'm careful when deleting things __eou__ backups are great though __eou__
Is this a question ? __eou__ If yes , how to check ? __eou__
once __eou__ can you give a pastebin of the output of : lsb_release -a ; uname -a ; dpkg -l | egrep ' **unknown** ' __eou__ something like http://pastie.org or similar . Thanks __eou__
Thanks . __eou__
thank you __eou__
do you know how do I disable samba then ? __eou__
then why aren't you logging in with your msn account ? __eou__
Terrible design . Any way to get around that ? __eou__
no bad thing :) __eou__
it didnt crash on you ? __eou__
yeah __eou__
What can you reccommend ? Gnome or MATE ? __eou__
that 's it __eou__
I'm well aware of that __eou__
Sorry , I'm wrong ! Ignore me :p Yes ... they're fstab options ! Add them alongside the other options in fstab , comma-separated __eou__ Here 's an example http://askubuntu.com/questions/120/how-do-i-avoid-the-s-to-skip-message-on-boot __eou__
" auto " is default , which means it gets mounted automatically during boot __eou__ noauto will deactivate that __eou__
fair enough __eou__
okay __eou__
i changed the one partition to a UUID , but the actual lines with errors are bind mounts __eou__
all ok now ? __eou__
then say : /msg ubottu ! ispconfig is blahblahblahtext __eou__ just change the blahs __eou__
! dvd | julia __eou__ if you want unity2d , log out and select it from the login screen __eou__
we need the context : what kind of system , how are you connected ? are you in a GUI ?... __eou__
No I dont - since I experienced the opposite :) __eou__ However , lets move on :) __eou__ It works for me . __eou__
justtry and install what you want , you'll be told if it 's already installed __eou__ no worries dude __eou__ depends on the requirements of the OS __eou__
there is alsamixer in Ubuntu too .... __eou__
ppa ? __eou__
mmm , i think kde partition editor would take careof that , right ? __eou__
now ... this partition is for fileserver and backup storage , so what partition system between ext3 and ext4 would give me better behavior/performance on that scenario ? __eou__ afaik , yes ... just two things make me think about ext3 ... more tools do exist for it that for ext4 __eou__
ah __eou__
hmm , may be a thing __eou__
probably worth exploring ..... if its the wrong command , it won't change the volume will it __eou__
presumably , yeah , they're just using a default installation . Ah , right . __eou__
very hand __eou__
worked , thanks ! __eou__
i dont care :P __eou__
5% ? oh , and I meant withing the ubuntu os partiton __eou__
depends if you want bleeding edge ;) __eou__
sudo service lightdm start/stop/restart like we mentioned earlier today __eou__
would it be the same for both windows and ubuntu partition ? __eou__
ok __eou__
Its an older Ubuntu distro and Chromium seems to freeze my screen __eou__ mouse still moves , but the screen is frozen and i have to do a hard reboot __eou__
i searched for ' pidgin __eou__ ' too __eou__
are you using Gnome desktop ? __eou__ so , KDE ? __eou__ should still work with gksudo , try : sudo vlc instead __eou__
thanks but its my machine at work and i'm at home - i might try it tomorrow __eou__
alright , thanks anyway __eou__
hello __eou__
thx ill find out __eou__
how to install it ? __eou__
Yes , I know then after that process Wine didn'e load the game I had download __eou__
so it 's just less secure ? __eou__
go to the page with the video you desire , copy the address in the browser address bar then use it in cli with the youtube-dl command __eou__
I think I got it . I put a link to the executable into ~/ . **unknown** __eou__
wireless g ? __eou__
If you don't know what your doing yes , is that the crux of your problem ? __eou__ Can you boot the live cd , and run a command or post an image of gparted ? __eou__
well if they manage to make it work something like wubi __eou__ that will be plenty good enough __eou__
whers my money __eou__
**unknown** , use ntfs for your windows natively __eou__ **unknown** , linux provides ntfs driver to support accessing some windows ntfs partitions :d ... __eou__ thats ntfs-3g play a role __eou__
thanks __eou__
do a update-grub when you done and it will always be there __eou__
let me give you the rundown first __eou__ the webcam is connected directly to my router __eou__ what I want to do is be able to access it from anywhere outside my wireless lan __eou__
python-indicate is already installed __eou__
you know if the new version of word runs in wine ? o.O __eou__
Yeah , I believe puppylinux is now slack based as well . __eou__
basicly , web browsing , email , cam chat with wife while im deployed , watching movies , and music __eou__
and how do I do such a slackbuild ? __eou__
he has already created the space w/ Windows ( if i recall , he said he split a 600gig drive in half ... 300 for Windows , 300 for ubuntu ) __eou__
lol __eou__
yes , thats correct , but again ... you're not looking at this problem he hsa created .... 1 . he has already created the free space ... __eou__
if by manual you mean the SOMETHING ELSE i believe option __eou__
because you told him it couldn't be done ... and yes it could . __eou__
thanks __eou__
I did address him . you were simply tagged for clarity . ;) __eou__
**unknown** !!!! I was using alt+spacebar and although it said move wouldn't let me . Thanks so much , it seemed like such a silly problem to have , lol !! __eou__
im not sure __eou__ ya thats what i mean __eou__
no problems , you've been awesome ! thanks for your time ! :) __eou__
the output of nmap should give you a list of scanned ports __eou__ or you can post a list of the open ports to pastebin and hopefully the channel can tell you what they are __eou__ which 4 __eou__
i did that __eou__
ok __eou__

I would recommend doing a normal dual boot install , rather than using Wubi . __eou__

yes . I can see why some of the people in here are so snippy sometimes __eou__ yes , that 's exactly what he was doing __eou__
nevertheless , it gets through 500mb very quickly , then it slows down considerably __eou__

in general no ... he already has a windows AND an ubuntu install , and must do the required every X months windows reinstall . __eou__ so in his circumstance , he needs to leave his existing install alone .

does that bug match your symptoms ? __eou__

No , i just want to know the driver used in my 12.04 . __eou__ can you let me know ? __eou__

disagree with what ? __eou__ then you're taking the wrong approach , ubuntu is linux - the linux kernel 's disk controller chipsets , especially on raid cards is well documented __eou__ getting one of the supported chipsets is the simple way of resolving it __eou__ you won't find one with specific ubuntu support . __eou__ and as different ubuntu version have different linux kernels ( and therefore potentially changing hardware support ) you need to treat each one as a different distro the same as fedora , or debian etc __eou__ yes , and I've given you one , the raid controllers are well documented in their chipset support , anyone of the cards that uses those chipsets should be fine , however check it against the specific kernel you are going to use __eou__

what are you doing to do that ? __eou__

yea you might wanna look at some light weight desktop environment . I bet you can find one you like that allows you to do what you want and not clock you box either __eou__
ah . I see . I have 2 GPUs __eou__ so , i can use Xinerama only right ? __eou__

did you install it from ubuntu **unknown** __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
sure you can have ubuntu , kubuntu , xubuntu and lubuntu all installed , but they run separately and have apps that will run cross desktops , but it can be a mess for some especially if you want to remove any of them anf their metapackages without some knowledge in doing this . __eou__ and* __eou__
ok , cheers . __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1255172/ __eou__ yup , thats a full desktop environment with its apps __eou__
yeah , the table does say ' partial ' support . I think that 's all you're going to get from F/OSS . __eou__ although it does say " **unknown** fully supports **unknown** v6 syntax " __eou__

What I'm showing is what the kernel give you back when you query /proc/mounts . Nothing to do with how you specify it to the mount command . __eou__
Getting this sort of information from the kernel into other programs is in fact exactly what /proc was designed for . __eou__

you can search the page for " freez " __eou__
there is usually a readme file , an install text file to guide installation __eou__ if you can find a deb version of the same file it would be much easier that having to compile __eou__
yes anyways thats the whole reason behind learning tarball __eou__ winrar was just an example __eou__

as suggested , a router capable of running a sshd can be used for this . a more sane approach would be openvpn , or something like a cisco asa vpn gateway __eou__ depending , of course , on intended usage __eou__ Gallomimia : lucky . mine still hasn't shipped :) __eou__ yes __eou__

its an option . You could grow the extended partition ( if this is possible ) then you are ok . I don't have this stuff as I plan my partitions __eou__

gnome 3.6 was released 6 days ago , 12.10 is out on the 18th , it isn't that large a gap __eou__
see his post ... policy indicates it does not exist __eou__
sorrry I didn't understand you , there are lots of books and docs that tell you to troubleshoot booting issues by editing grub and use init =/ bin/bash __eou__

What does " dpkg : error : requested operation requires superuser privilege " tell you ? __eou__ no . __eou__ no . the semicolon separates commands . sudo dpkg -i **unknown** . deb __eou__ again : what 's the full output . __eou__
the kernel doesn't understand " single ". That 's for the boot magic , Debian includes . It might very well decide to prompt for a root password before giving you access . init= circumvents that by telling the kernel to run it ( i.e. bash ) straight away __eou__
why not use unity-2d or gnome-panel ( classic , no effects ) __eou__
it 's not tho , pretty powerful machine and I'm willing to sacrifice performance for easy-of-use __eou__

actually I was looking at that earlier . It contains the packages I need but I'd rather have the repo so I don't have to install every package individually __eou__

if you buy a newer , faster model , you should be fine on all respects . But I have no anecdotal evidence to share except on a 401 __eou__

on start-up i get internal error , after clicking show details , i noticed it says something about /usr/bin/ubuntu-sso-login < or something similar __eou__ so the details would be ubuntu-sso-login crashes at startup __eou__
sudo apt-get remove torchlight correct ? __eou__
Did you really except what you just said to be helpful support in any way ? __eou__
what will the steps look like ? __eou__
II haven't tried adding deb or deb-src lines from newer versions , because I expect the deb lines to break things . I can't account for you being unable to access newer sources . My usual method is to install build-deps from the release I am running , then apt-get the matching source , download the newer source and patch that __eou__ did you do an apt-get update after adding the dep-src lines ( without the deb lines) ? __eou__ s/dep/deb/ __eou__
yep , I'm talking to you over it __eou__
Mine is an ASUS manufactured one __eou__
thought so __eou__
if you're using apt from command line , you can't install stuff from software centre at the same time __eou__ which is what it looks like if dpkg db is locked __eou__
it won't take too many minutes , so why does it matter ? :p __eou__

have you contacted the maker/maintainer of heritrix ? __eou__
okay , so hcitool echos back hci0 < mac address of controller > but the bluetooth devices panel keeps disconnecting and reconnecting the device ( or so it seems ) any idea why that would be ? __eou__
Obviously , you have . And it 's a choice of the manufacturer how a device is connected . It 's the choice of the manufacturer which bus ( usb , pci , spi , whatever ) is chosen to connect that device . __eou__
can you say anything else ? __eou__
whats a/d __eou__ cyphase thanks for your help __eou__

ok __eou__

don't use natty , don't use ppas __eou__
the install thats going to be replaced is seldomly used and is quite messed up configuration wies - it was my experimental install __eou__ so i thought a nice clean 12.04 install would be nice - apart from puzlying around with grub - not shure where to put it __eou__ if i place the grub of 12.04 in a pratition within the extended partition - will it be recognized by the currently installed grub from ubuntu 10.04 ? __eou__
yes __eou__
Oh ... actually there was an unoficial package here before __eou__ I removed it and so ... __eou__ Just saw the apt-cache policy output ... __eou__
check ufw , enable the port from that . __eou__
i was just going to suggest raid :) __eou__
can i boot the cd on windows and install directly on the pen ? __eou__
of course it is , but I opened the ports + source __eou__
doable . but you have to use the grub 2.0 documentation __eou__ see this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup __eou__

as would anything else ? __eou__
I completely agree . Was just commenting on the asking price . __eou__
actually , if it 's not in the repos , it 's not supported here , better contact the maintainer __eou__
haven't tried anything yet . I'm still pretty green @ Ubuntu or any *nix for that matter . Trying the recovery kernel now ... __eou__ repair broken packages did the trick - thanks for teaching me to fish . __eou__

thank you , i will try now __eou__
sda5 is linux part . __eou__ i have chroot up and running already __eou__
I was thinking something like xwininfo -root -children | grep " window id : __eou__
you could put " alias xx='chmod a+x ' into your . bashrc file , then just type " xx filename " to make " filename " executable . You would have to log out and back in , first , to make the alias active , but then it would be there forever . __eou__
I never use the menu . But looking at it , I don't have Firefox in there either . So it must not ad hooks , or add them in a non-standard place , as expected by debian . menu __eou__ ah . awesome doesn't have tiling support . It just does **unknown** . __eou__
it 's a pretty slick grub fixer __eou__ but it doesn't seem to be in the repos anymore __eou__

that explains why system( "... /sudo " ) worka ... __eou__

I meant don't install directly to the USB , instead , copy the Live CD files to the USB and use a persistent casper file . __eou__ then try LiLi __eou__
you can backup personal files to ubuntu one or dropbox __eou__

ok __eou__
it 's not installed __eou__
sorry but i am typing . not pasting ! __eou__
no ... because starting mplayer as normal user wont work ... mplayer just exits __eou__
No its not . a rescue cd can only help if the windows OS installation files are intact properly . But from your gparted , I don't think they are there . Yes , as ardchoille suggested , save your current files somewhere and then try out stuff . __eou__
it looks like what you did was split the hard drive in half in order to install ubuntu but then installed ubuntu on the wrong partition - removing Windows 7 __eou__ you can partition it and use it , but I would look into what **unknown** said first and possibly recover files __eou__ befor eyou do anything else , save your personal files to the cloud or a usb key , just to be safe __eou__
I have installed the right font I think . Its the **unknown** font . Other similar fonts like webdings and windings all display fine __eou__
nothing special ... i just did a minimal install and now i'm checking all functions ... sound , wifi , drivers , programs , merging old conf , test permissions and so on __eou__
Benkinooby yeah , gnome-session perhaps __eou__ no , just adding info I thought might help Benkinooby . My system is perfect here __eou__

I'm running Unity on Ubuntu if that 's what you mean by using a gui ? __eou__ ok , I figured it out - my fault entirely . I'd installed Firestarter and then closed it , figuring that it was switched off ... but it was blocking new local outbound/inbound connections for some reason . __eou__

you can't do that you'll loose the buttons . __eou__
Are you using 12.04 and Unity , or another desktop environment ? __eou__ OK . Not got LXDE installed on this one . But program launchers should all be using XDG free-desktop properties files . Have you surrounded the program-name and parameters with double-quote marks ? __eou__ usually , you'd create a . desktop file in ~/ . **unknown** for the application __eou__ And that isn't working ? I'd have thought it should , too ! __eou__ Is it a default system-created shortcut ? Or one you originally created that is now not working as expected ? __eou__
there is a #c++ channel . __eou__

well , sorry I couldn't offer an explanation on that for you . best of luck __eou__
:p OK ... just trying to get a picture in my mind of what would have happened and how to fix it . The core of the issue is the disk has a GPT ( GUID partition table ) rather than a ' legacy ' MSDOS partition table . One implication of that is when the GRUB bootloader is installed , it should be installing " grub-efi " rather than " grub-pc ". __eou__
I just want to see all computers on LAN in terminal . __eou__
i do not want any x , like gnome etc .. __eou__
and what was the output ? __eou__ and what 's the output of **unknown** uname -r **unknown** ? __eou__ well that 's silly __eou__ same issue on earlier version : http://serverfault.com/questions/230767/how-do-i-install-kernel-headers-for-vmware-to-match-my-running-kernel-version-2 ( read for hints ) __eou__ there 's also some discussion here with a link to a vmware forum topic : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1596105 __eou__ you may also want to try the vmware channel for their advice __eou__
No I didn't because **unknown** fails with an error telling me to check jockey . log , as it always did for me with 12.04 and Radeon drivers , on multiples laptops . I tried to install fglrx via apt , but it 's not really helping . __eou__
I read that manual already __eou__
ok , so what should I do now look at the page there on __eou__
type sudo apt-get update|pastebinit and paste the url here __eou__
the explanation is the first step toward a solution __eou__
no problem . __eou__ You can make a list of everything installed with dpkg -- get-selections > installed-software __eou__
do you remember which packages were installed when you played around with the sources ? __eou__
so do you have any unofficial packages installed or unofficial repositories enabled ? __eou__
lots of dependency problems which I could not understand __eou__
I see __eou__
ok =) __eou__
yep thats it __eou__ what i should do ? __eou__
k thx . Do u have some basic guide of inkscape usage ? __eou__
the server is unaibale __eou__ ok , i`ll try that =) __eou__
I'm not a pulseaudio fan , but in some cases such as pci soundcards it 's needed to work with website audio like flash/flv embedded files . if you have it then pavucontrol would be a benefit for input and output settings __eou__
I tried and it the same , I did a fresh install and now I'm not even able to click the checkbox ... __eou__
gdm is also a login screen . Lightdm is the default login screen . They serve different functions than unity , gnome shell , and metacity __eou__
hmmm , i see 3.6 . 0 on kernel.ubuntu.com , but i'm not sure how to get a ppa set up __eou__
it doesn't work __eou__
Ethtool indicates that WOL is active . __eou__
I'm using the latest Firefox and I installed flash via flashplugin-installer . I also tried getting the libflashplayer . so and putting it in . mozilla/plugins to no avail . __eou__
ref pm __eou__
thanks , I'll give it a try ... something I have been looking at also is setting up raid array , do you know if this can be accomplished this way ? It looks very difficult . __eou__
type the first few letters of my nick and press the tab key __eou__
yes , BluesKaj mentioned something like that __eou__
that makes me feel better ; thanks . __eou__
so a deb file is just a tar file ? __eou__
oh ok __eou__
see theadmin ; as he says , vino is installed by default , but you still need to enable remote access on the machine __eou__
This is a support channel , I expected a support question . And it seems to work for my own uses through cclive , but I don't use justin . tv __eou__
that makes sense as they're also slow to reply on their irc channel ... __eou__
i forgot :D __eou__ atleat this time i tried to scroll up but it wasn't in my history __eou__
ah __eou__
Oh , that 's just finger info , you can put anything in there or even leave it blank __eou__ It 's not critical -- it 's displayed by various apps such as GNOME 's user info tool __eou__
That might not have anything to do with codecs __eou__ Video drivers maybe __eou__ Oh , okay then , um ... Corrupted file ? __eou__ What media player do you use ? __eou__ Hm ... Not sure at all __eou__ Well if VLC fails then it 's quite likely that everything will __eou__ Oh okay then , crazy __eou__
Generally , " man command " will give you help on any command __eou__
k , so now do I press Ctrl-C ? __eou__
yes , I think it 's " **unknown** " that is there __eou__
ah __eou__
compizconfig-settings-manager ( though ccsm on the command line after installed ) __eou__
they're not *that* different __eou__
just stop those random comments please __eou__
I thought that 's what grep did . __eou__
yeah i know that __eou__
uhh ... your client controls colors :) i have no idea what color 's you see and it 's definitely not what i see __eou__ you wanted to install StarCraft 2 right ? try here : http://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-661-Starcraft_II_Wings_of_Liberty.html __eou__ and try here http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20882 __eou__ learn how linux works , learn how servers work , learn to program , learn about security , whatever fancies you __eou__ and of course web developement , whether basic website design to advanced stuff all done on linux ( unless you're wacky ) - most of the web runs on linux so that 's a start and it 's all free to use and to modify __eou__ sure __eou__ ubuntu has an awesome server guide __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ __eou__
same as what ? __eou__
ok , like i said , i don't do wine :) __eou__
awesome ! __eou__ officially you shouldn't but of course you can do whatever you want ( i use ccsm heavily ) __eou__
jrib : ty __eou__
Ah bummer well that is the policy , but treat that as you will . ;) __eou__ Just in case you need it there is also ##linux , you never know if you will get answers here . ;) __eou__
lol :) im so fustrated __eou__
works for basic stuff __eou__ I'd ask in #launchpad __eou__
#ubuntu-unity maybe ? __eou__
perfect , thanks ! __eou__
thanks a lot __eou__
the gui __eou__
so not under the network tab ? __eou__ actually there is a proxy tab ... __eou__
140 packages seems a bit extreme __eou__
honestly : if you need to ask that question : it wont __eou__
its better to ask " what are these processes " instead of " can i kill them " :) __eou__
When you use regular FTP that isn't encrypted or tunnelled , the user password goes over the wire in plain text . It is very susceptible to a M-i-t-M or eavesdropping attack __eou__ That 's correct __eou__
ok __eou__
you're right , sorry - i would submit a bug report __eou__
do you know what distupgrade means ? i don't think you are clear on it . see " /msg ubottu distupgrade " for details . best of luck . __eou__
I have server why not use it __eou__
**unknown** . 0 Network controller : Broadcom Corporation BCM4318 [ AirForce One 54g ] 802.11 g Wireless LAN Controller ( rev 02 ) __eou__
I don't want 0 , 10 would be fine , but it is infinte __eou__
thanksss ! __eou__
not sure that is true , I never use software-center and it has everything here __eou__ usually I just use /var/log/apt/history . log and a bit of **unknown** __eou__
sorry - I don't know __eou__ cron assumes that the machine is always on __eou__
duckduckgo has a bang for PPA searching , makes things fast __eou__
can you test ir for me ? I xan connect to it . __eou__
hmm i see . i shouldn't think of it like gentoo . I was thinking of PPA 's as the same thing as Gentoo overlays . But that 's obviously not the case ! __eou__ i'm content with ghc 7.4 . 1 , then : ^) __eou__
you just need the IP , the interface isnt important when accessed from outside __eou__
but will you ? ha ha ha __eou__ lol seriously no please do __eou__
always sir . it really hurts my eyes __eou__
how do i open python __eou__
not or me __eou__
does Gparted see them ? __eou__
nice ;) __eou__ do you have data on there that you " care about "? __eou__
where can I find them ? __eou__
nope . __eou__
ps __eou__
yes , if the line is currently showing the res it is at now __eou__
it removed 2 , any more ? __eou__ **unknown** : __eou__
This is ubuntu support you might try #ubuntu-offtopic . ;) __eou__
i actually had them installed in 10.04 , just started the upgrade steps to precise this afternoon __eou__
ubuntu , as in .. someone at Cannonical , or the OS ? __eou__
python __eou__ python __eou__
http://askubuntu.com/questions/162011/synaptic-wont-launch-from-menu-in-panel-in-fresh-lubuntu-minimal-desktop-12-04 < -- This solution might work for you getting to launch from the menu . __eou__
not sure ... i creat it usin usb-disk command __eou__
hmm . you named it " / "? __eou__
I tried what you suggested but nothing happens . Typing firefox in the terminal window just gives me a prompt . __eou__
and a different USB port ? __eou__
nk opinion is fact opinion __eou__
u dodnt get me __eou__
sure chek that .. some said that may be the fat32 not being recognice for the old bios ... but when tring to instal the usblive on the flash formated on exfat it gives an error on the syslinux instalation .. sais won't be bootable ... __eou__
ohhhh nice __eou__ thanks __eou__
, ok amigo lemme burning this winxp on usb first __eou__
http://i.imgur.com/J19oN.png __eou__
I can't even get to the list . __eou__
what accepts this %u parameter ? __eou__ Oh . printf ? __eou__
got it : /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/$connection __eou__ oops . My bad . Sorry . __eou__
ok __eou__
listen to Martell ;) __eou__
trying to find the link ... __eou__ ok , here come links ... __eou__
cheers . __eou__
hmm ok by doing apt-get autoremove it removed the rest i think __eou__
either your burn stuff to a **unknown** , not a CD*ROM* ( ROM = Read Only Memory ) ;) __eou__
sorry , only just joined __eou__
ejv :o k im trying __eou__ ejv : its finaly installed . tnx for helping my friends . __eou__
or admin@blah __eou__ i think ddwrt uses ' admin ' __eou__
thanks __eou__
It use to work automatically ..? __eou__
yes , everything works fine locally ( WOL & SSH ) __eou__
2d woks __eou__ *does not work either __eou__ i could log in though gdm though __eou__
sure , that should do something closer to what you expect ;) __eou__
thank you __eou__
i have been through all versions and 1204 has been a nightmare :D __eou__
true __eou__ what makes me feel sad about ubuntu that i switched to ubuntu on 8.04 because everything seemed to work __eou__ now after 4 years , nothing really works anymore __eou__ thanks :) __eou__
ok ty __eou__
vpn __eou__
does cron have any gui to use with that ? __eou__
the keys work during boot up but after the o/s loads they no longer work . __eou__ also I've tried passing switches to grub and still that doesn't work . __eou__
my disk 's are pretty much partitioned out into one big drive and I use virtualbox to seperate the space that I need __eou__
see article http://www.linuxscrew.com/2010/11/25/how-to-monitor-traffic-at-cisco-router-using-linux-netflow/ __eou__
It 's always morning on the interwebz . __eou__
yeah appears the ppa is no longer active , ill have to use this as an excuse to try out **unknown** 's networking libs :P __eou__
yep , probably worth a comment on that bug just to get a discussion started about it __eou__
yes __eou__ ok si i got another issue ( not related ) can't ping public IP __eou__
xournal ? next on my list to try ^^ __eou__
he can do that after the install anyway .. unless he got a ton of stuff in it .. **unknown** __eou__
in which case ' fetchmail ' is designed to do what you describe . it downloads from pop3 server and then puts into local **unknown** . __eou__ which can then , of course , deliver to maildir . __eou__
ok first off ... sudo fdisk -uc /dev/sda then do ' p ' and chcek the list again __eou__ we can try to delete the swap and it ought to be able to create a new one on reinstall __eou__ does the list still have ' sda3 ' as the swap ? __eou__
you can ' scp username@servername : remotefile localfile ' etc . __eou__ its worth going past the '' i will only deal with things that seem easy '' barrier you get further that way . expand your mind . ;-) . __eou__
So I can't just change the ending sector from 34420 to **unknown** ? __eou__
ah , got it , this one seems easier . thanks __eou__
could be that your default profile folder naem is too long __eou__
im not a webmaster , but i see no reason why the webserver should have writeaccess to all files . just limited access to single files __eou__ " $user : www-data " and set sgid on /var/www too __eou__
that one did not work either , same error __eou__
rip a CD into a VVBR MP3* __eou__ The " Edit profile " button is grayed out . __eou__ so it only rips 128kbit mp3's. __eou__
maybe that repository isn't woring any more ? have you tried giving details to the person wor creates that ppa ? __eou__
I don't know what this means __eou__
How do i open terminal here __eou__
ok they are all set by static . __eou__ not sure then tbh __eou__
could it be because ubuntu 's reposi ? __eou__
partition on drive and i think it becomes bootable __eou__
and what do you mean be ' super simple ' etc __eou__
ok and does that give you gnome-2 or gnome-3 ? __eou__
yeh sorry __eou__ that 's what i meant , nautils is taking too much memory ! __eou__
why ? __eou__ it 's just a current unity version eg : 12.04 __eou__
Is it just with unity ? __eou__
so how are you at 3GB ? __eou__
what ubuntu version are you upgrading from ? __eou__
let me get a video for you lelouch __eou__ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ __eou__
check top output __eou__
sorry , cant i drag and drop files between host & guest ? __eou__
the kubuntu package .. __eou__ and some Nvidia related **unknown** . __eou__
Oh , I agree . __eou__ no , jrib was wondering if there was some process gone awry I think . We're not worried about memory usage itself , but clearly something is misbehaving on my system . __eou__
I'm not sure then , it would only be a shot in the dark . if you really want to find out that would be the best way . __eou__
Dude if you show an attitude no one will help you . __eou__
lsb_release -sc will tell you :) __eou__
! details > blackhole __eou__
it 's ubuntu 12.04 . should i use mplayer or mplayer2 or ..? __eou__
not sure the details , but modprob can show you which modules the kernel loads . you might need to add some modules and reboot . __eou__ this might help : http://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration __eou__ actually , not , nm . __eou__
I can't see any way of **unknown** a default scanner __eou__
oh ok __eou__
aw ok then i wait until i can access the computer ;( __eou__
set up an ssh tunnel , or reverse tunnel and bind it to that port __eou__
pastes are not showing up try http://paste.ubuntu.com/ please __eou__
then you are good to go __eou__ pick Ubuntu . I will take screenshot plz hold __eou__
I can not see that paste just tries to load but does not . Please use Paste **unknown** __eou__ can we see rfkill list all && uname -r \ __eou__ can we see rfkill list all && uname -r __eou__ what is the output of uname -r __eou__ now open a new tab in the terminal shift+ctrl+t then enter in cd ~/Desktop/ && wget **unknown** __eou__ cd Desktop && tar -xf **unknown** 2.6 . **unknown** . tar . bz2 && cd **unknown** 2.6 . **unknown** && . **unknown** then make then sudo make install __eou__ that should take care of you ethernet __eou__ after compat is done you can try this for your wireless sudo rmmod rtl8187 && sudo ifconfig wlan0 down && sudo modprobe iwlagn 11n_disable=1 sudo ifconfig wlan0 up If wlan0 is the correct thing check with ifconfig __eou__ reboot __eou__ then come back here for more de-bugging __eou__ pastebinit will auto paste stuff for you on paste.ubuntu.com __eou__ try this sudo rmmod rtl8187 && sudo modprobe iwlagn then please run ifconfig to see if wlan0 or ra0 or whatever wireless is . Is it there now ? __eou__
sure , isn't it possible to do like apache does ? Like have the /etc/init . **unknown** start | stop | restart ? __eou__
thanks a lot __eou__
i'm in , thank you __eou__
sure i d keep that in mind __eou__
ok , have some vodka in the freezer for just an occasion . thanks __eou__
Yea , go ahead and download the 12.04 alternative CD and try to boot from it , then see how things look ( AKA you can get online , etc .. ) . I don't know if you can upgrade your existing OS from this point though - I've only attempted an upgrade from within the OS needing to upgrade . __eou__
thanks __eou__
not sure it 's in there :) __eou__
here is kind of an ugly hack to get the default value with a script ( while preserving the user value) , it may have the side effect of weird settings on the desktop momentarily as apps listen for values __eou__ argument and error checking is left as an exercise to the reader : **unknown** __eou__ then you could do for something in gsettings **unknown** for key in gsettings **unknown** schema , get the default value , etc __eou__
i thought it was using joli ? __eou__
how did you add it ? __eou__ also can you point out the ppa link so I can look ? __eou__
I noticed in his mount , he has " **unknown** , **unknown** " Would those be the mount permissions for accessing the device ? __eou__
" lspci -vv " command should do it __eou__
well Im running mysql as the mysql user , it doesn't have access to create the pid file in /var/run .. so I created a /var/run/mysqld and gave it chown mysql : mysql **unknown** __eou__ well what would you suggest I do then ? __eou__ would you rather have mysqld run as root so it will have the right write permissions on /var/run ? __eou__
ok , I'll try , but do I get a direct link using youtube-dl __eou__
I don't mind . __eou__
Add the wine-beta repo , and then apt-get update && apt-get install wine 1.5 __eou__
But localization is the last thing I want to implement before shipping my app to ubuntu software center D : } __eou__
You probably can't. __eou__ I've never used Apple products so I never cared , but all I know is that there 's no iTunes on Ubuntu __eou__
I agree , but you can install all those apps , the software store is called " software-center ", the music player that comes by default is Banshee I think __eou__
i would try forcing the vesa driver , should be good enough for standard resolutions , openchrome 2d acceleration with EXA is really experimental still and isn't even in the mainline kernel yet : **unknown** __eou__
try removing and reinstalling with apt-get __eou__
such a boss , thanks mate . __eou__
I didn't select one . It says " **unknown** . drv " but theres no option it just tells me __eou__
The whole project uses getstring / getpluralstring for gettext support __eou__
please post what you are getting in pastebin __eou__
I've herard of them both I'll take a look thank you :) __eou__
use whatever works for you __eou__
A wildcard in the filenames , yes . __eou__ it will find **unknown** . deb and **unknown** . deb too __eou__
Well , not really , but I do like a good discussion , good night though __eou__
Yes . __eou__ It crashes . __eou__ Oh great . __eou__
eh , I've found it quietens things down a bit __eou__
I still get sound . I didn't remove alsa __eou__
you can use sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop-environment for the " normal " ubuntu __eou__
ty __eou__ unfortunately doesn't have any of those packages heh __eou__
I have extras , and vlc plays fine . so why not mplayer ? I'll install lame , but why ? __eou__
I see ... __eou__
the settings are probably in dconf/gsettings now though you'd still have to know where . gconf/dconf/gsettings were never meant to be manipulated directly by the user __eou__
update-motd was missing __eou__
yes its working thanks __eou__
open a terminal and type alsamixer and check there as well __eou__
Really ? I thought it was an optional extra to install , and I've read lots of places saying it 's dangerous __eou__
No chance then . __eou__
Where under Computer ? /media and /dev under File System are the only things that seem like they could be it , and they just have empty folders . **unknown** __eou__
/dev/sdb1 * 62 8047227 4023583 b W95 FAT32 __eou__ its sdb1 and its NOT ntfs .. its ' vfat ' __eou__ unless you have a totally failed hard drive .. thats not showing up at all . __eou__ so look on /cdrom ;) __eou__
hi that was fast ! Yeah that 's what I thought __eou__
I'm installing 12.04 to a cluster of machines via network installer . I monitor it via IPMI/serial over lan . It works great , except at 31% through the installer progress it **unknown** hangs . I press enter on the serial console , it continues running to completion . __eou__
server ? no I don't think so __eou__ did you mean I could use 8.04 as a server ? __eou__
You are not the first to request this option there is info on the web , this channel rarely advises on wubi so the help is sparse here is all . __eou__
: thanks but i did that already . Lots of talk involving mounting an array that didnt auto mount , but my situation is more complex . I have a drive from a machine that died that i want to mount on a new host that already has its own array and i dont want to screw anything up here __eou__
admin has passwd __eou__
ok , thank you . __eou__
Ah , I forget how the remaster boots but I think it looks like a regular ISO , but you should of course do what works for you . ;O 0 __eou__
I used it for about a year and a half and still do sometimes cube and all , but I find gnome 3 nicer . YOU should also have the gnome-fallback in that dropdown it is a similar to gnome 2 setup __eou__
nope , never heard of it .. google here i come .. anything else ? __eou__
lol __eou__ i can work things out . but i'm just trying to guage whether it 's feasible to use linux as a development environment . and when simple things like the latest popular netbeans osftware isnt available __eou__
no wait . i mean , when i type ~ . **unknown** > it auto completes __eou__ but when i type . **unknown** > it doesnt ? __eou__ yep . im in the ~/Downloads directory __eou__ nope . it 's a . sh file . i just downloaded it __eou__
is the file marked executable ? __eou__ the name will be green if it is __eou__
depends on access to each folder for your user __eou__
adran sorry its in a con **unknown** so its a place for configs ( face palm ) __eou__
whoops . __eou__
I think it does that __eou__
I just put the old www instate of the new www. __eou__
My old www. . __eou__
you should have said that .... __eou__
, the keys used to authenticate packages might be no longer valid or some of them __eou__
lol , im just realising , was it stoopid to paste my key in here ? __eou__ same error : S __eou__
, than you should first remount the parition as readonly and than try extundelete __eou__
That is the answer i am reffering to __eou__
i don't think so __eou__ does nouveau is unloaded with some kernel parameters ? __eou__
Thats no setup , that are hardware specifications . __eou__
nautilus elementary is no longer being developed or supported __eou__
, all i want is , my tv be able to transmist port 443 transmission via the proxy __eou__
don't know what that is __eou__ there 's also #ubuntu-server __eou__
How so . The problem is we need to authenticate through AD for the network shares . __eou__
my netbook is packard bell i cant see the keyboard for it __eou__
: me too .. my friend want help . :) __eou__
thanks , but my ubuntu can't step into that interface __eou__
proxies do that normally __eou__
ouch __eou__ if you need a **unknown** solution , you're probably better off with CentOS , they have people who deal with this sort of thing __eou__
the iso i get form ubutnu site now , will it have all updates included ? __eou__
anywho , 12.10 discussion is in #ubuntu+1 __eou__
why would anyone use telnet : x __eou__
do you think it is possible to have a look at a log of the system to check what could possibly be causing this issue ? Because it is the second time in two days . __eou__ I mean , in less then one day now . __eou__
whats the exact file name ? last i looked they were 720mb in size __eou__
wubi isn't meant to be used as a long term solution , its more of a try before you dive in thing __eou__
yes __eou__
then what ? __eou__
if I boot into ubuntu and replicate the issue , will you guys support me then ? : | __eou__
if we in lucky , there are some packages needed in apt cache dir __eou__
- thanks -will do __eou__
whatever it was . you need to remove that line 7 and then follow the proper java install guides __eou__
It does . __eou__
it 's come kind of electrical issue , I think __eou__
i can just use gentoo and not be **unknown** with that crap at all __eou__
yeah , well **unknown** . If you can access any sort of external data , you're fine and good to go with anything you want , really :) __eou__ O_o __eou__ ... __eou__ yes __eou__ well . I would fire up a webbrowser , go to the search engine of my least mistrust and type something like " apache reverse proxy ". I'm not going to do it for you though . __eou__
that is not very helpful . __eou__
: when i open it in win7 with notepad it was empty .. __eou__
trying that now , thanks __eou__
and the public network interface has DHCP . __eou__ yes , ubuntu . __eou__
looks elegant , glad I could help :) __eou__ i'm stealing that from you __eou__
Not sure , in my dhcp config , it asks me for both . __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
can't figure that . :( __eou__
well . I would fire up a webbrowser , go to the search engine of my least mistrust and type something like " apache reverse proxy ". I'm not going to do it for you though . __eou__
Yeah it creates an ISO file , but I'm not sure if it has a pure CLI version __eou__
is install ccproxy ( a windows proxy app ) a good idea ? __eou__
Yeah but right now i m using browser but when i trying to connect through XCHAT then it 's showing .." Connecting to chat.freenode.net ( **unknown** . **unknown** ) port 8001 " __eou__
sure __eou__
i'm there already .. __eou__ and where should i ask about questions related to ubuntu.com website ? __eou__
: where to type that ?? error is :: * Looking up irc.freenode.net * Connecting to chat.freenode.net ( **unknown** . **unknown** ) port 8001 ... * Connection failed . Error : Network is unreachable __eou__
N is not the option . I'm saying seq PUT_A_NUMBER_HERE -1 1 __eou__
also , this is not a Ubuntu issue so it is off topic for this channel , you might try asking ##hardware . __eou__
do you happen to know if your system is a UEFI system ? prior to installing ubuntu did you have any prior linux on there or did the installer resize the windows partition ? __eou__
yes ... good idea ... :) thx __eou__
Then try lsusb instead of lspci __eou__
may I pm you ? __eou__
wish i did . i looked it up when he handed me the drive . don't have the name now . let me see if i can find it __eou__
if the harddrive is still working , you can mount the first partition using mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt __eou__
metioning the wasted money on an unused drive usually prompts the user to begin using it __eou__
regardless , getting support to learn how to use aircrack to hack into computers will likely not lead to any support in this channel . __eou__ sorry , I won't help with that __eou__
Just connect to your wifi using your password . __eou__
and **unknown** : It looks like main partition and OS , which is sda1 and sda2 respectively . There is a third partition which Windows uses for Rapid Start . The rest will be for Ubuntu . __eou__
then you need to acquaint him with the art of backing stuff up __eou__
No it 's not for rescue . I already deleted that . __eou__
network was working before ? __eou__
.. thank you I'll check those out as well . __eou__
yes it is from install cd . __eou__
i downloaded it from ubuntu . si offical site for ubuntu is slovenia __eou__
you can use torrents and it'll verify every data packet as its received . __eou__
It will work , but it will go back to " **unknown** " as soon as you reboot __eou__ if you need to have it last , do this : for i in hostname hosts ; do sudo sed -i ' **unknown** ' /etc/$i ; done __eou__
Thanks . And thanks to everyone else . __eou__
I have submitted your last suggestion . Heopfeully these will be added . __eou__

So that means ? __eou__
how do i sell a app in the software center __eou__
How would I know __eou__ I'm sure I can produce others that might not argue that . ;) __eou__ I think the sync has to be under the users files __eou__ The files on the OS __eou__ with a quick google I see this a portable dropbox for a usb . http://www.petenetlive.com/KB/Article/0000409.htm __eou__
Make sure it is burned at the slowest speed , I assume you have checked the md5 on this download . __eou__
Just checked the web page , its 404ing __eou__
Thank , I'll give it a try :-) __eou__
sure __eou__ its not compulsary __eou__ why not use pidgin ? __eou__
I've alredy told him that . :D __eou__
I can now use the last end of 192.168 . internal __eou__
actually , it 's not mine computer , but the user says that there 's no such option . __eou__
no windows __eou__ using Putty as ssh __eou__
nope , the ip address is correct . __eou__
That would be even longer XD __eou__
i an there too __eou__
oh ok __eou__ so using MobaXterm instead of Putty ? __eou__
ye __eou__
ye i wanna add more amount __eou__
which is what guntbert has been saying all along , you're a tad late to the convo :/ __eou__
i guess i would check network settings , make sure the netmask is set correctly __eou__ and that it 's definitely got the right config by doing ifconfig __eou__ i would also stop any firewall on the host with iptables -F __eou__ it could be anything to be **unknown** __eou__
here . we spoke about these lame hax0rs lol . __eou__ all of them do it , LCDs are not as bad as plasmas tho , then again ive only owned one plasma __eou__
oh there we go some thanks :D __eou__ http://pastebay.net/1149460 ' sar ' dont looks like it working __eou__
do you have access to sudo ? __eou__ you have to use jacktheripper or something equal before you can get passwds from that __eou__ boot the liveCD , and mount -- bind the / root , and procfs to /mnt __eou__ then chroot /mnt __eou__ next time , say the user forget there password __eou__ boot the live cd , mount -- bind /dev/sda1 /mnt ; mount -- bind procfs /mnt ; chroot /mnt __eou__
when your chroot , does passwd set it on the livecd or the binded mount ? __eou__
find the old deb and install it __eou__
but make sure that you are permitted to run that survey __eou__
perhaps , although I'd argue that inexperienced users will have a harder time avoiding the removal of critical desktop packages __eou__
How did you enable it ? :) __eou__
as applies in windows microsoft installation of any software is to go up to setup file then open it will start execute __eou__
I hope so :) I've seen some suggestions online that they will happen right away __eou__
ok am waiting for u to direct me on that case __eou__
i didn't had permission to save a file so i thought root was the smartest idea ? __eou__ i was to lazy to read that ^_^ __eou__
i got it from here http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html#374 __eou__
I would not call it spamming , I simply made a single post in two different channels because it has to do with Ubuntu as well as the server edition ... __eou__
it was automatically run during the install , but after the first failed boot , I booted from the install media ins to recovery mode and ran grub-install /dev/sda __eou__
i am asking about precise __eou__
directX triggers , likely , but that 's a whole ' nother story :) __eou__
boot flags mean NOTHING to grub __eou__
this address came up as warning with the option to turn it off http://s0.2mdn.net/879366/inpageGlobalTemplate_v2_71_03.js:71 __eou__
ok __eou__
okay thanks . __eou__
If it was me I would search with the exact info on the hardware and ubuntu , but I suspect you already have . __eou__
I made the USB with **unknown** Disk Creator __eou__
I`m in lubuntu quantal right now , and it only has package manager for some reason , it has software center in 12.04 __eou__
Well , my problem is that I'm installing the server ( instructions found @ **unknown** ) and down to the last step and enter in the following command ' sudo dpkg -i libsimias*deb **unknown** ' but get the following in my terminal : http://pastie.org/4925125 **unknown** is like it doesn't see any . deb files __eou__ true but I want to test this software out **unknown** . I know you need to run a . /configure command but all I see is a . /configure . in command __eou__
what about sources . list ? __eou__
i think you ave mix multiples sources __eou__ i think you need remove that packages caused the problems __eou__ if you trust me , you should purge it __eou__
i dont think so **unknown** have expirience in Linux __eou__
There is a lock on the bios I have a aceraspire one have you unlocked it ? __eou__
do you use the 64 bit version ? __eou__
thank you i will check that out __eou__ hrm , maybe i am missing something , but im not getting any relevant google results . could you briefly describe what you did to solve the problem ? __eou__
- masquerade and ip_forward set up on the laptop that takes the signal " in " to my router __eou__
try ip route help in a terminal for the full list of options __eou__
its not something i know much about __eou__
This is a ubuntu install from windows a wubi ? __eou__
At least mine is predictable . After reboot , works w/ hardware button once , works with eject /dev/sr0 once - then nothing . __eou__
thnx :) __eou__
you might try http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html __eou__

Thankyou . __eou__
yeah , that link has a makefile in it .. [ after " Append the following text " ] __eou__
it works , but seems to be a little verbiage . Fine , it works well :) __eou__
Agreed , now if only Shell could get the option to use it , we would all be happy hahaha :) __eou__
do u use terminal daily ? zsh has many other features too .. u will find it useful __eou__
i tryed USB stick , with 12.10 but when it come to i should choose installed them by side ( Dual **unknown** windows on it ) it just says thath there was no OS Detected ... and it only give me to format it and few other options __eou__
The program ' **unknown** ' can be found in the following packages : __eou__
what you mean ? I dont collect them :d thats useless __eou__ read rtfm , it should help you so mich __eou__ read the fucking manual .... __eou__
ah ok .. __eou__
It does . KVM supports the passthrough of PCI/PCIe devices . So you can pass through your graphics adapter and your USB controller to a vm . __eou__
you mean install python from source ? __eou__
take a look at my post just now __eou__
apt-get source coreutils __eou__
pkill is only kill one process at a time . its not working if i give multiple names __eou__ i used like this pkill -9 thunderbird , xchat __eou__
Yes ... __eou__
got another computer __eou__
ok , sorry for that __eou__
- any suggestions why internet no longer works when i set up static IP on eth0 ? __eou__
ok , do you know the regular expression i could you ? __eou__
and when you upgrade those deps ? what happens to the apps you isntalled that were designed to be installed on other systems ? __eou__ the best policy is to never mix distro packages , doing so will eventually cause you problems . __eou__ have you checked the ubuntu repos for the apps you want ? the ubuntu repos are huge __eou__ ok , good thing you asked beforehand :) __eou__ part of the problem will be deps . package A might have satisfied deps now but if those deps are upgraded by the ubuntu update mechanism then package A may not have satisifed deps because the ubuntu upgrade didn't upgrade the cross-distro **unknown** ) __eou__ you might also ask in the wine channel , #winehq I believe __eou__
nope i am not on ubuntu , cause i am trying to install but no sucess yet because i will creat dual boot ... Now i am on windows __eou__
that is the question . Just feel like I am getting less performance and little niggles I never had before and previously always felt it was much faster etc after new install . __eou__
' win32* ' should be win32* __eou__
you put the address of your router __eou__
**unknown** . gvfs is " probably " where nautilus mounts things ... __eou__
i don't know what format used by metafile download __eou__
So how do I access this " FOLDER " from the cli __eou__ So how do I access this " FOLDER " from the cli __eou__
$ sudo umount /cdrom umount : /cdrom : device is busy . ( In some cases useful info about processes that use the device is found by **unknown** ) or **unknown** )) __eou__
you definitely need a fixer expert __eou__
nope . __eou__
ok I try __eou__ I can't, his parent is gnome-session __eou__
can't imagine ... worked with previous versions before just fine , gotta work now again __eou__
im having **unknown** trouble even finding executable of synaptics ! __eou__
can we pm over this ? __eou__ RealTek or something like that __eou__
something like apt-cache showpkg packagename ? __eou__
yea i know i can run the old styled session __eou__ all im saying really is , the new UI is ... not very userfriendly . search is awesome however if you dont know what to search for - youre kinda fubar __eou__
i understand __eou__
The driver is irrelevant when passing it through to vbox . __eou__
well , i want to know everything about the partitions i have ... __eou__ and actually , i'm pretty advanced on computers ... i just never used ubuntu ... so i'm a bit confused about all those partitions ... __eou__ **unknown** , __eou__ i have a project __eou__ but it 's like open source ... you won't get money .. lol __eou__
i need to configure all the partitions .. __eou__ and i don't know , do i need all primary partitions ? __eou__ well , i want to know everything about the partitions i have ... __eou__
why don't you write the command i could you to make me a favor ? __eou__
Probably okay right now when the channel is slow but pastebin is preferred . ;) __eou__
there 's only one OFFICIAL tutorial given by the Ubuntu Dev team , and that 's the one i've been working on . to sum up all of your questions : yes ... and no , it didn't work __eou__
/join #centos __eou__
do you use digital cables ? __eou__ do you use one cable , or more ? __eou__
I'm trying to find the chip the the creative labs card uses , any idea , I thought they were intels __eou__
Not sure to be honest , I have been to busy with grad work to mess around other then to root it and tryout roms . __eou__
i will iam just trying to stop my servers ^_^ __eou__ hmm ... i rebooted my desktop , and pressed ubuntu ( iam dual-booting with windows ) then i got a purple screen with the options ' ubuntu with linux ....' ' ubuntu with linux .... recovery mode __eou__ so i pressed ' ubuntu with linux ....' and it just went purple __eou__
i get a tty , though i'm not sure why you are asking me __eou__
in that case sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^ <- the ^ is important . __eou__
still nothing , it didn't even turn black or anything __eou__
I thought you meant to do it while it was mounted . If it 's not mounted and I do it then the permissions of the directory I want to mount it in just changes to root : root __eou__
you need to disable the gnome bluetooth manager first __eou__
Its totally sweet , one more question tho i can go back to the default view at anytime by selecting the options on the login screen right ? __eou__
i edit the ' ubuntu with linux ...' the line with linux i typed nomodeset at end , then i pressed F10 to boot , and i got ' The system is running in low-graphics mode ...' and i pressed OK and then that window came up __eou__
ah , i understand what you want now , sorry for being so slow , sorry i can't help either __eou__
did you try running jockey-text on tty as already suggested ? __eou__
okej i will do that __eou__ where on windows can i find the ubuntu files ? __eou__
Fixing might take 5 minutes . __eou__
you arent giving that user shell so it doesnt matter __eou__
then you should be fine with the jockey-text installed driver . optimus is a laptop thing __eou__
Also check your spam folders . __eou__
I was told that the system would be in an unusable state and hence had to run dpkg . May I assume that it is in a usable state again if dpkg succeds ? __eou__
thanks . Any url link for this please ? I can't find it elsewhere __eou__
i dont see it __eou__ strg ? __eou__ ctrl+f7 ? __eou__
ah , thank you , ill check it out __eou__
You take the stick , and walk into the shop where you bought it . __eou__
my guess would be partial/incomplete download ( server disconnects earlier , etc ) __eou__
trying to login by selecting UBUNTU 2D in that dropdown menu gives the same result __eou__
so i would ctrl-alt-f1 login and run unity -- reset __eou__
i have formated it some days ago __eou__
precisely __eou__
thinkT510 I tried but I cant __eou__ i cant run lightdm even as root __eou__ sudo lightdm outputs : Failed to use bus name org . freedesktop . **unknown** . __eou__ yes __eou__ i was just running it to see what it did while lubuntu-desktop installed __eou__ **unknown** : it is installed now but it 's still not working __eou__
and if you are running an iptables firewall you probably need to open that as well __eou__
i was just running it to see what it did while lubuntu-desktop installed __eou__
i think screen would do what you want . alternately you could setup a watch file __eou__
Thanks :) __eou__
I was careful , that 's why there were no typos :P __eou__
no - like gordonjcp just said __eou__
does ' sudo fdisk -l ' show it at all ? __eou__
A different one , but I check the link for the script this time and it is still valid , http://www.webupd8.org/2009/05/ubuntu-script-to-automatically-install.html __eou__
OK , needed to be sure . Now ... the *current* sda , is that the device that should boot during a normal start ( it 's not a USB device for example ? ) __eou__
^ __eou__
go spam your cash click links somewhere else . :/ __eou__ good , give her a razor and let her finish the job . __eou__
yeah , it 's the same in pretty much any distro __eou__ ah , that 's something different __eou__ same principle though ; you start as root and drop privs __eou__
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot what about this one ? __eou__
let it drop please __eou__
hehehe __eou__
ok , I'll try disassembling it tomorrow and changing the capacitors . I've changed the capacitors on the power board earlier , so bad capacitors on other boards sounds like a plausible thing . Thanks ;) __eou__
why not ? It 's ubuntu based :) __eou__
that answers that __eou__ sorry lol I started typing then read that and forgot to delete my text before typing " well then " __eou__
what does that mean __eou__
I'd use dd __eou__
i've used sudo dpkg -- force-depends -- force-architecture -- force-overwrite -i . **unknown** 2.15 **unknown** 10.2 _i386 . deb __eou__ and sudo dpkg-architecture -l reply 386/686 as 386 headers and kernel installed and used at the time __eou__
extreamly __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
maybe you should gauge the interest in either buying out the source , or making a modern remake __eou__
I feel for you - in the past I've spent 3 weeks recovering NTFS file-systems for businesses __eou__
then you have the wrong h/w ;) good luck . __eou__
Compiling is okay . Just as long as I don't need to do it over each time I want to play :] __eou__
at least this one should be available and looks clear __eou__ as i remember luna looks very similar to clearlooks but have more smooth colors __eou__
no just update-initramfs ( it reads from /etc and structures the initramfs file in /boot ) __eou__
ok , thank you __eou__
you want to freaking bond wifi links ? __eou__
you have a good point . :O P __eou__
fyi , they're different ! client has different port/style address ! pita they're not the same . __eou__ that 's exactly what i used to do . delete the cache and start again . __eou__
none of which worked when I selected them __eou__
Just to test to find out . If the problem is with flash then it may still be graphically related . Try the newer chrome builds with pepperflash and see if that helps __eou__
( although you're already gone) . sorry , wrong nick . __eou__
it 's the acer inspire one __eou__ when I use the mouse , all 's well , when I boot to win7 , all 's well __eou__ I guess there is something wrong with the driver __eou__ too bad the right click is pretty useful __eou__
not breaking __eou__
wait a minute __eou__
you mean like xfce ?? __eou__
from the error you pasted earlier it would be sudo apt-key adv -- recv-keys -- keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 437D05B5 __eou__
i upgrade my ubuntu but now i m not able to logon admin account __eou__
no idea . I believe their is software that works like itunes but I've never used them __eou__
apparently it is empty ? __eou__
yep i do know sleep - i was just wondering if you **unknown** **unknown** something else instead of sleep ;) __eou__ i think reporting bugs is a pretty good way to improve it . ubuntu-bug is a nice cmd for that . just as 1 option __eou__
could be wrong . Someone else asked earlier and that was the repl __eou__
ah ok . Thanks for that :) __eou__
I think the biggest hurdle for that will be getting the keyboard shortcut to know what the value of pwd is at any given moment . The nautilus-open-terminal can do it but that is a right click tather than a kb shortcut __eou__
If that works , boot back into a live session and wipe the old /var dir __eou__ You'll need to take care that the files retain their ownership and permission bits after the copy __eou__
ah , yeah , its a card reader :/ __eou__ would it help if I open up my laptop and get the name of the card ? __eou__
that 's what we're talking about . I suggested he keep both /var/s until he could test that the new one is working as expected ; then remove the old one . __eou__
and you say the script works fine when run manually but fails when in a cronjob ? __eou__
what fails when using cron ? does it run at all , does it just misbehave ? some details would be helpful __eou__
ahhh . I just saw the cd in main . I understand why the others say relatives paths are not an issue . Big mistake on my part . sorry __eou__ previous comments about environmental variables and relatives paths apply to **unknown** . sh too __eou__
ok i am now getting error messages from cron . and it is while copying new files . __eou__
after a duckduckgo search it looks like there are no linux drivers for that broadcom chip __eou__
I don't think so . Based on the numbers you've provided ( at least since I've been in-channel ) look totally normal to me . __eou__
http://www.basicconfig.com/files/content/manual_partition_ubuntu07.preview.png __eou__ there is mount point ... without setting it install will not start __eou__
yes I want the shell script to work from cron too as it works running from terminal manually . __eou__
you're welcome __eou__
.. I'm not 100% sure on this ( I still do most of my Linux networking the manual way) , but I believe that *all* of those GUI tools for network management are just front-ends that call stuff like ifconfig , iwconfig , and modify your resolv . conf __eou__
rename and find __eou__ ! resolvconf | HTDutchy __eou__ you might also ask the #samba guys what they suggest __eou__
When running some applications ( specifically Far Cry 2 ) my desktop cursor stays in the middle of the screen __eou__ When I move the mouse the cursor moves for a little bit before returning to the center of the screen __eou__ The in game cursor works fine __eou__

yes , I'll do it at once __eou__ it is here http://pastebin.com/5QXPKFQ9 __eou__

hmm .. thanks __eou__ **unknown** " manual " | sudo tee **unknown** . override ''' is this valid method for disabling NM ans sticking with etc/network/interfaces ? __eou__
but you want to know what all comes installed by ' default ' you mean ? __eou__
I don't have a CD and the only thing capable of writing one is my laptop ( my desktops CD drives are screwed - . -) __eou__
and you can't do that from a regular user ? __eou__
It doesn't really __eou__ if you can chmod and chgrp the first attack vector is a self built suid binary which allows you to do just about anything __eou__ i think you will want to setup samba with ldap and kerberos for what you are after __eou__
your usecase is not that of a typical ubuntu user __eou__
2 reasons , firstly , the automatically created user is likely to conflict in UID with my existing users and 2 , deleteing the user is an extra step __eou__
not once the system is configured , i have a daemon that manages my users and config files , once its running it disabled ssh root login , though i still like to have a root poassword for console login __eou__
: ok that extra space will remain there as unformatted . __eou__ that 's the point right ? __eou__
what about people who wish to use nis , or those ( like me ) who have automated scripts to create and maintain their user accounts __eou__
we can turn on admin rights for them , they're paying for the server , if they mess it up , it 's their server that gets hosed __eou__
no , i want to chroot a user to a homedir but gives me this message : 500 OOPS : vsftpd : refusing to run with writable root inside chroot () __eou__
sorry , I can't help with Windows as I haven't used it in ten years __eou__
combined them ? __eou__ you making a cluster ? __eou__ whatever you want to do sounds out of my skillset __eou__
if you have 8G RAM then 8G swap ( for hibernation ) . place iot at the end of the partition table .. how large is your ext partition for ubuntu ? __eou__
thanks got that too __eou__
its under process will tell you whether it worked or not __eou__
thanks __eou__
wilee-nilee Yes it 's the same disc __eou__
and what i type into mountpoint ? __eou__ root ? __eou__ or just / __eou__
not really , it 's kind of inherent in the terminal __eou__
i'll check the manpage , thanks . __eou__
windows 7 __eou__ hmm what to do now . D ? __eou__
what do so __eou__
interesting . never had a problem with it being not installed , but that seems about right . thanks . __eou__

Hexchat is the same , I guess english composition is a challenge at times for all of us . __eou__ It is like a second language here . ;) __eou__
it won't tell you anything if you're american __eou__
YOU never want to use theirs it will not follow kernel updates . You would only use theirs if nothing else worked . __eou__
i've never set up a lamp setup , so i'm not going to be much help __eou__
I really don't know . I don't have any experience with GTP/ UEFI . My pc is fairly old and so are the drives except for my external media drive , so grub works on all and it sees my W7 install __eou__

ThinkT510 : ok . thanks . __eou__

why not just stop apache ? __eou__
so you have 3 primary partitions and one extended parttion __eou__ make a new extended partition on the freed space . Then make your usual Linux partitions as you desire __eou__
okay then __eou__

the reason for this is to have private key authentication on our collection of servers instead of only passwords . and having a password in addition to the keys/passphrase seemed unsafe and redundant __eou__

to be honest I have no idea what swaps are for __eou__

Of course , you can enable pubkey authentication for user dimas and disable the ssh password login for that user . __eou__ In that case , you still will have to enter the _password_ when using sudo as user dimas . __eou__
i had never heard of a jumpdrive , but there 's this ( learned something new myself ) http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-usb-ubuntu-linux-boot-jump-drive/ __eou__
Yes ... **unknown** 3.1 would store a secondary boot loader in the boot sector of that partition , which would in turn be able to read the " command.com " executable from the root directory of the file-system __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ looking at the manual there isn't. But I was wondering if there was a cli trick ? __eou__
we are talking about backup solutions __eou__
But I realize that doesn't work for everyone . __eou__
I got them ; I probably didn't enable the module __eou__
one sec let me check __eou__
no i mean making it boot from ubuntu jumpdrive and get the kernel from /mnt/jumpdrive/boot/kernel-name and then use the usual squashfs in whatever directory on the jumpdrive __eou__
yeah . the lived will detect the windows install and configure GRUB accordingly . its very user friendly __eou__
the thing is , i'd rather not having a slower worse version __eou__ I like ubuntu __eou__
OK , so it is no Ubuntu . And thus not supported in here __eou__ It is not an official Ubuntu derivate , and thus not supported in here . __eou__
reboot , stop in grub , edit boot command , add " single " to the boot arguments __eou__
I'm actually on that page ;) __eou__
diamonds , bekks , are you logged in youtube ? __eou__
yep . ho boy , that caused me some trouble :) __eou__
i have not found one , but that does not implies that there is a possibility ( dark evil hack ) ;) __eou__
tks for looking ! I tried with fat , I'll try with ntfs thanks __eou__
and when you type " su - ben " can you login there ? __eou__
yup __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
I'm running ubuntu __eou__ tks for looking anyway __eou__
no problem , nice work :) __eou__
yeah thats what i am thinking .. so you think its safe to just do an update to 12.10 now ? __eou__
How to get to the mixer ? __eou__
i just reinstall stuff as i need :) that way i end up not reinstlling cruft __eou__
compile from source would be another option . trying to use old packages , silly imo . best of luck . __eou__

you don't have to reinstall ... just use mdadm instead of lvm to set up the two drives __eou__
see my above statement __eou__ in any case , I am in need of other help ... sorry to butt in pointlessly __eou__ I will look to see ! brb __eou__ taken straight from the man pages , gimme a sec to paste __eou__ Deinstall I am in need of some help ...

after I first installed , there wasn't an option ... I'd installed another ... kubuntu or something , and then I got two choices . __eou__ Is there a DM that I can install that is gnome ? I don't suppose it 's called gnome . __eou__

12.04 __eou__
well you may lose everything , so back up your data , and use gparted live cd to resize the mint stuff to make room for ubuntu __eou__ http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php __eou__ ? no .. you dont have to .. __eou__ you can resize the mint partition with the lvie cd tool i mentioned __eou__ when you make at least 7 gigs free .. you can add a " ext4 " partition for ubuntu __eou__ it 's up to you how you want to make space ( i've never given any instruction on how to work with mint , it 's not the purpose of the channel ) __eou__
so boot a recue environment for it __eou__

well I know what the error means , but I'm not sure how to fix it __eou__
yeah the thing is , when it got laggy even after the work is done the console is a bit slow in response , even a simple ls or cd takes a blink of an eye longer than usual __eou__ or even longer __eou__

then ~/ . xprofile or a . desktop file in ~/ . **unknown** ( this is what 's used by the gui for creating startup applications ) should work __eou__

that 's a crazy lookin ' mouse . good luck . __eou__
& ThinkT510 .. oh god .. NO I DO NOT .. reread please __eou__
it 's one of the checkboxes there __eou__ it 's one of the " flags ", rightclick on the partition - flags - bootable __eou__
what do you use in replace of it ? __eou__
" lspci " __eou__
, I sort-of have an understanding of that . However , I was following some guides and I think that they're out of date . __eou__ , http://ppa.launchpad.net/nginx/stable/ubuntu/dists/ is where I'm at . __eou__

i've got several fail messages for processes that're nonexistent on my system , i just ignore those , if everything else is working , i'd put no true attention to it . __eou__
if you are not on 12.04 then you should upgrade - also in case you need a newer version that is not in the repo you may want to look into the xorg ppa on launchpad __eou__ no idea , works for me ... you should read that wiki __eou__ it no doubt depends on what tablet you have ( maybe it uses some non-standard wacom hardware ) __eou__ anyway , good luck ( i need to get going ) __eou__
So it looks like you have a boot partition for ubuntu not needed but thats okay , the boot flag is not needed there but actually on the sda1 for the windows install and use . Just use the custom install in the windows install to use the sda1 . You also have a sda5 unknown is this a swap and is this all encrypted ? __eou__ Actually the sda2 is to big for a boot , so just move the flag to sda1 , and you should be okay , The swap is showing as unknow is this due to a encryoted setuo ? __eou__ You would know if you encrypted it , it is a extra process to do that . I would remake the swap by just clicking on it and remake the swap , do not delete it first as it will change the partition number . __eou__ unity ? __eou__ There is one for the gnome-shell that works up to 12.04 __eou__
So I should install mysqld ? __eou__ If I knew where to find it , that is . __eou__
too bad i know it now :( __eou__
I have broken my network manager on ubuntu 12.04 LTS desktop __eou__
NOt sure to be honest I have not messed with window managers . The key I think is understanding how the ones stock work like in the unity desktop as it is a bit unusually set up __eou__
did you try " apt-get check deluge " ? __eou__
I'm not sure how to find that . Thanks for the link ! __eou__
there is an error __eou__
trying the easy route first . go . __eou__
well it was already compiled i was trying to run the program __eou__
ah , I was talking to **unknown** , but looks like he 's gone __eou__
Ahhh . You may be able to use a USB serial link but that will depend on whether the EFI has configured a port __eou__ Sometimes in these cases I aim a video camcorder at the screen , and afterwards play it back in slow-motion __eou__
if you check out the ones already in that directory you should get the general idea , or if you have gnome-panel install you can use gnome-desktop-item-edit to create one __eou__ in software-properties-gtk Switch to the Updates tab and set Notify me of a new Ubuntu version to For any new version , then try again __eou__
That should work . if not , there 's something else on that system/network causing issues . __eou__
Thanks ! __eou__

" PORT **unknown** " __eou__ That causes your client to be told ( by the server ) that it can't do a direct connection , so the client then asks for PASV mode , the server replies ( 227 Entering Passive Mode ... ) ... and the connection times out after " **unknown** " - that tells us the client isn't establishing the DATA channel correctly __eou__ I'd use tcpdump for this . You need to know if the client is **unknown** a connection to the server 's DATA port . tcpdump should reveal which end is having the problem . I'd suggest it is the local firewall on your LAN __eou__ If the LAN 's local firewall policy for outgoing connections is restrictive , it *may* block outgoing connections to **unknown** numbers (> 1023 ) in order to ensure clients are only connecting to **unknown** __eou__

but seriously -- do you know how I should enter this particular variable for " JAVA_HOME " in a script ? line looks like : export **unknown** : - " **unknown** " } __eou__ thats what I've done so far -- does that look right ? __eou__
Thanks ! Exactly what I'm looking for . __eou__
I installed xbacklight too , xbacklight -set 50 says " No outputs have backlight property " __eou__ ... this is a LED screen with a backlight __eou__ you can't change brightness in xfce/lxde , no GUI for that __eou__
one solution could be nomodeset , else fiddle around with ccsm option ? __eou__
hmm ... my situation is that i started to grow a raid array in single user but now i cant really check its progress in another tty which was my original plan __eou__ i htink i might just be stuck until it 's done __eou__
I have the problem of going in excess sometimes __eou__
wubi ? __eou__
it should autodetect __eou__ but careful when you partition the drive , if you do it wrong , you lose windows . __eou__
i wouldn't recommend it , they won't conflict __eou__
thanks __eou__
no idea , there 's one way to find out :) __eou__
ardchoille do you guys think that upgrading to 12.10 will help solving any driver issues ? my wireless card is always dropping ( I've been trying to fix this for days and hours , nothing , reports on launchpad of other users ) __eou__
nevermind -- works in firefox :) __eou__
sorry I am not sure about that card . I have only had a 8800 myself and gave it away . I am sure that there is a solution have you tried googlubuntu.com ? __eou__
thanks to you , I am to put any splash screen with super-boot-manager . But I still have a problem how to put text information of loading system ? __eou__
What was your question ? __eou__
short and sweet , thanks . :) __eou__
bobweaver , I have tried disabling acceleration , and purging and reinstalling __eou__
wrong channel to ask __eou__ ext4 __eou__
lol yup __eou__
can we please do some debuging ? what is your browser of choice ? __eou__ **unknown** < --- blue bunny ? __eou__
i can't work with this crap called gnome 3 __eou__
yup . Using nvidia and twinview and GUI looks like it should do the right thing but doesn't. __eou__
again thanks . I've been avoiding unity by using cinnamon , but that goes wonky from time to time . __eou__ I have 2 monitors and there is the unity taskbar on the left of the left most monitor *and* a taskbar on the left of the right most monitor . Right in the middle . Anyway to turn that middle on off ? __eou__
isnt MBR old ? __eou__ nce a remote prospect , an important barrier in disk storage has become a reality : the venerable master boot record ( MBR ) partitioning scheme can't fully handle disks larger than 2.2 TB ( **unknown** . With disks as large as 3TB readily available and with much larger RAID arrays common , alternatives to the MBR partitioning scheme have become important to understand . The heir apparent is the GUID Partition __eou__ Table ( GPT) . __eou__ Hmm i think it is GPT __eou__
there is dpkg-source and dpkg-gen something cant not rember of top of my head .... googleing __eou__ http://www.tin.org/bin/man.cgi?section=1&topic=dpkg-gencontrol __eou__ there is also dch but you would need source package and at that poiint could just read debian/changelog __eou__ ! info dch | crazydip __eou__
chking for dpkg-dev __eou__
looks like Ubuntu __eou__ I can't understand what the guy is saying , sorry __eou__ sorry , I just can't make him out at all , I'm not very good with accents __eou__ he 's speaking English so maybe someone with better English can try it __eou__
k , thanks __eou__
perfect , thanks :) __eou__
I did do a proper build order __eou__ I'll try another CD hold on __eou__
fdupes in terminal ? thank you __eou__
I thought it had to be shared alike though __eou__
It 's in you-tube __eou__
I realise Wayland is a long way off being a viable option , but the point I was making is that the tearing might not because smellysally 's integrated graphics needed beefing up - the tearing could be down to XOrg . According to following article XOrg can be cause of tearing : http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/unity-to-embrace-wayland-display-server __eou__ Perhaps the SandyBridge bug depends upon which kernel you are running . I have a SandyBridge cpu which I got not long after release and I had problems but now with newer kernel works great ! __eou__
I want to install Windows , I have it on a USB , when I get to the install point I get an error message saying that the file system needs to be ntfs , all my drives are Fat32 to my knowledge , I need to format the drives , but I don't want to accidentally format them into the same file type and end up with two blank disks that I can't do anything with because they're in the wrong filesystem still __eou__
it is refering about cpu usage __eou__
you will need bumblebee . __eou__
starting from scratch with a clean install of ubuntu . No vlans , my network is flat ( although I might break it apart soon , but still without use of vlans ) __eou__
Fair enough . Some people like Nvidia because it offers excellent performance including VDPAU . However , to get the most out of it you need to install a binary blob of secret code which some users do not like to do . There is an open source driver called " nouveau " but it 's performance is vastly inferior to the proprietary driver from Nvidia unfortunately . __eou__
ok will this get the proprietary driver sudo add-apt-repository ppa : ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates ? __eou__
I was reading on this website ==> http://www.ubuntugeek.com/quick-tipplymouth-themes-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html => but the info is TOO OLD __eou__ look that __eou__
go ahead __eou__
is there anything I can do about it ? __eou__
first do : " sudo apt-get autoremove " then " sudo apt-get autoclean " then " sudo apt-get -s upgrade " and show the output of that __eou__ btw the -s flag in apt-get is for simulate which means it will run a simulation __eou__
It tells it not to display on your screen , but instead write to the log I believe is the intent __eou__
i did what the site said and i got Unable to locate package oracle-java7-installer __eou__
thanks __eou__
there are tools like janitor and bleachbit __eou__
yes . that works for me at least :) __eou__ if it still doesn't write anything to the log : is this a user 's crontab or root 's crontab ? in the first case check if you have write permissions to **unknown** . log __eou__
Thanks . /etc/hostname worked a treat . __eou__
ok , glad you found it __eou__
I get the following error message : The following packages have unmet dependencies : __eou__ unsure how to proceed from here __eou__
You're welcome :) __eou__
no . I did it once this morning and my whole OS crashed . I had to install it again . I did it a second time , and now my Desktop looks weird as I explained __eou__
That seems to be the consensus . Guess I'll walk over there . __eou__
I'm trying to get my code to build on win/linux so not a good idea . I'll try that __eou__ ended up creating a directory called " __eou__
And what topic do I look for there ? __eou__
yea its attempting to install now thanks . ill let you know how it turns out __eou__ it worked thanks for your help __eou__
maybe this : xrandr -- output LVDS1 -- primary -- auto -- rotate normal -- pos 1366x0 -- output VGA1 -- auto -- rotate normal -- pos 0x0 __eou__ if not try this : xrandr -- output LVDS1 -- primary -- auto -- rotate normal -- pos 1366x0 -- right-of VGA1 -- output VGA1 -- auto -- rotate normal -- pos 0x0 __eou__ xfce4 is pretty dumb when it comes to panel placement from what i know __eou__ if all those fail install and use arandr __eou__
what is the name of the script ? __eou__ sudo sh **unknown** 304.51 . run -- uninstall __eou__
hehe I installed something ( I've been installing everything that moves in Ubuntu Software Center LOL ! ) and it brought along KDE with it and switched my login screen to kdm .. __eou__
And so am I __eou__
Thanks a lot ! __eou__
I wish you luck with that . __eou__
you keep on saying that nothing works and then give no reasons to why it dont work __eou__ let me guess there is no **unknown** . conf __eou__
did you disable Unity ? __eou__
they are defined in /usr/share/xsession it seems . __eou__ a desktop set of default apps . __eou__
d4rkw0lf ping to anything apart from 192.168 . 1.4 ( me ) fails . can't resolve anything __eou__
it copied it back into the tmpfs __eou__
that should work __eou__ no need , but thanks __eou__
yes __eou__
nope , does **unknown** ? __eou__ your using a very old xmms __eou__
thats already allowed . __eou__ which requires a livecd , or a cd with the grub repair iso on it . __eou__
look in the AUTHORS file in transmission 's source tarball and send the patch to the person who is maintaining the package __eou__
you can mount the slice with windows , and compress the content . redo the slice for linux , and just reverse it later maybe ? __eou__
i dont expect my systems to crash like yours then lol . __eou__
you might be better off using -- **unknown** __eou__
you're right . I'm forgetting that some don't keep a separate partition for /home __eou__
Not that I have seen , dual boot a windows is what I would do . __eou__
I suspected linux , that is why I said I would look for one that has touch screen capability , I'm not sure ubuntu does . __eou__
i cant wait to check it out , sounds like the perfect thing for my 10 thousand roms , if i can get emulators to run on it __eou__
I've tried **unknown** , vsftpd , proftpd , and more ... __eou__ I know what the issue is , it 's something to do with the permissions , and shell __eou__
hummm __eou__ i was trying install nvidia drivers __eou__ could be that ?? __eou__ if i delete xorg . conf .. fix ? __eou__
good sugg . __eou__
well i have no problems with pidgin but microsoft likes to play with it 's protocol once in a while ; you might need the latest emesene __eou__
that 's true , but not all grub installs have the rescue mode , it would depend what version and which distro . __eou__
it is probably exactly the same look __eou__
do what ? __eou__
from live cd , mount the drive . Then for just changing the password , You won't need to mount a bunch of other things ... then sudo chroot /mounted/path then make the changes needed . __eou__ if you are using a pen drive then it will not likely be on sda1 __eou__ sudo fdisk -l will show you the connected drives . __eou__
what about file zilla server ? if you cant make it run its mostly because you dont know too much of ips etc it takes little practice __eou__
403 Forbidden __eou__ ' twas a typo __eou__
what are those ? __eou__
you can open alsamixer ... or you can set it directly if you know the control name . __eou__ aplay -l | grep card | awk ' { print $2 } ' | uniq | sed ' s/ :/ /g ' | while read **unknown** ; do amixer -c " **unknown** " | grep ' **unknown** ' -B5 | grep " Simple " | sed ' **unknown** mixer control //g ' | grep -vi capture | while read **unknown** ; do amixer -c " **unknown** " sset " **unknown** " unmute ; done ; amixer -c " **unknown** " | grep ' \[ . **unknown** ' -B5 | grep " Simple " | sed ' **unknown** mixer control //g ' | grep -vi capture | while read **unknown** ; do __eou__ the numerical limit is not indicative of percent volume .

For this particular method , if the installed system is 64 bit then the LiveCD needs to also be 64 bit . If the installed system is 32 bit then either a 32 bit or 64 bit liveCD will work . You can find out if the system you're booted from is 64 bit by running " uname -m " in a terminal ( " x86_64 " means 64 bit , " i686 " or " i386 " means 32 bit) . __eou__
I have two saphire radeon hd 6850 's in crossfire __eou__ ubuntu does not recognize this video power and i want to know if its worth my time to bother trying to make it happen or just take the second card and throw it in an old box im using as a nas thats rarely accessed . __eou__ yeah I imagined as much I'm basically looking for someone to say that no one really has any idea how to make it work reliably so i can justify making a gaming rig out of that NAS box for my girlfriend when she comes to visit because gaming with her mac and my linux makes gaming a constant up hill battle . __eou__
I'll take a look at those , gota boot into windows first :/ thanks __eou__
I mean if I had precious little time with my girlfriend I would do other things besides gaming so I assume that was a euthinism :) __eou__
ummm your phone have wireless ? you have wireless setup in your house ? that wont cost you a thing __eou__ setup wireless imo or just plug the phone in USB and enable mass storage mode on your phone , done __eou__ MTP ? __eou__ your phone have bluetooth ? __eou__ no idea what MTP is __eou__

lol , fine i will try it via ubuntu 8.10 and see if it works , and when it does , i will come back and tell you that ubuntu 8.10 is still alive even though it might not be supported . aguadito i have a feeling it will work , ubuntu 8.10 is like a fail safe for me , it always gets job done when i am in trouble with anything relating to computers __eou__
do you have a suggestion on which version of ubuntu ? __eou__ wanting to get back into nix . Was a huge fan of fedora __eou__
jordan : ? __eou__ ???? what u mean " additional drivers __eou__ nvidia-current-updates __eou__
i dislike windows , with a passion , also i figure it will work in windows , from google it shows that i am not the only person in linux universe with this issue but multiple people from different OS seem to have this problem or a similar problem like this __eou__
do you have the autocad software installed somewhere ? __eou__

it 's useful i repeat last driver installation plus * . cat file __eou__
Oh my my !! it works ! thanks tons :D D __eou__
no __eou__ except for loading from podcasts ( from rhythmbox ) there were no changes between when it worked and didn't. Not that it immediately stopped working after the podcasts went on , but that was the last thing I did to it between when it did and didn't work __eou__ it appears to be mounting somewhere in /tmp now . I'm not sure if that 's normal . I didn't really pay attention to the mount location when it was working __eou__ Also , I've reinstalled everything except my home directory since it stopped working . So whatever changed , it 's probably in some config file in home __eou__ or at least that 's my current thinking , but I haven't figured out what __eou__
I don't really want to change the owner . llutz : Thanks , I've read that but acl seems a bit ott at the moment . I just ended up changing the group with chgrp to www-data and giving write to group . __eou__

If it works now , than I guess it is preferred ( from my point of view at least ) :D __eou__
if you find someone who still supports it __eou__
you should use 12.04 with whatever desktop environment or window manager you like __eou__
if it is related to 10.10 , yes __eou__ the intel drivers are related to xorg __eou__ so its not that easy to backport them __eou__
iceroot : 12.04 lts __eou__ not yet __eou__
it only shows one icon per application , then you have to wait for it to expand etc . it 's really awkward to use for me __eou__
i'm a bot , now please leave __eou__
i already stated my problem like 29 times . __eou__
Nothing on Google searches works ... __eou__ The typical answers are to modify **unknown** . cfg ( doesn't help ) or to right-click and disable acceleration ( doesn't help . ) __eou__ For some reason , it was fine with Flash 11.3 on Chrome , but now on Flash 11.4 for Chrome , the controls are slower and performance isn't as good . 11.3 WITHOUT hardware acceleration was actually much smoother . __eou__
i believe its : find /path -name * . iso -exec rm {} ;\ __eou__ let me google and make sure real fast . __eou__
before it gives you that screen you should see a grub menu or such , isolinux .... __eou__
if he 's installed it to /opt , it should write to /opt , I don't see a problem with this __eou__
So you're saying that canonical is help with a small " h " and is still reasonably affordable . I'm talking about a home network . __eou__
Do you know a good introduction/guide to find ? __eou__ They shouldn't activate if a full screen app is running , normally . __eou__
ok , so the disk is not being presented using the correct uid . Verify the UUID and compare it against your config __eou__
yes , but what system is or was installed on it , before you tried ubuntu ? __eou__ ok , then boot the other partition and check the not-working partition from there __eou__
thx .. __eou__
great , so you know your connection support of 25 clients is valid __eou__ so that 's onething you can tick off your box __eou__

ah , so it is that simple - but how do i know what will be in the data . log file ? the output of " mysql ", or " time " ? __eou__ oh , yeah , that seems like it would work __eou__ thank you . __eou__
you will need sudo apcces etc to install the package though __eou__

then run : sudo apt-get install gnome-shell __eou__ you don't need a PPA for that __eou__ then you may be able to press ALT+F2 and run : gnome-shell -- replace __eou__ I suggest you remove the PPA < it may be causing issues __eou__ mount can mount smb stuff __eou__
its a lot easier , you could try transfering deb files , could get messy __eou__ I suggest you use http://packages.ubuntu.com __eou__ echo b43 | sudo tee -a /etc/modules > /dev/null __eou__
never tried that - I do a reboot , and then start pressing shift ? __eou__

AdvoWork you could first mkdir -p **unknown** and it would creat it , then mv . __eou__ is your arch using grub2 ? Because I wouldn't think you would need to chainload ... simply installing/upgrading grub should find ubuntu , and other installs that are not grub1 ... as it is a chroot it would be an arch grub ... in which case the utility would work . __eou__
i have one route 192.168 . 2.0 /24 -- wlan0 and the route 192.168 . 2.1 -- eth0 is automatically added . After manually removing , it 's set automatically again . __eou__ Networkmanager could be ... __eou__ what 's its configuration file ? __eou__
i will get back to you once in recovery mode __eou__
If store exists , mv tries to be safe and doesn't just overwrite everything __eou__ You need to delete that directory if you want another directory to be it __eou__ it seems very confusing now , but the core utilities do make sense eventually heh __eou__

Thats wrong :) __eou__

Did you see the GRUB boot menu with the list of operating systems ? __eou__ OK , so at that menu you move the cursor to the Recovery entry , then press " E " to edit that entry . That takes you to a small text-editor style screen where you can move around with cursors and edit the text . So , move the cursor to the line starting " linux " and move the cursor to the end of it and add the text " nomodeset " . You can then boot with that modified command-line by pressing Ctrl+X __eou__

; im curious about that ... it 's a 8GB stick but the Fat32 partion limits it to 4.3 __eou__
it already supports 64 gig so I don't think most people have a problem with that anyway . And if you have that kind of machine you should run 64bit because then it 's probably because you have applications that need to address a lot of memory . __eou__
i hope you have reported a bug . best of luck man . __eou__
crack wpa via command line interface terminal mac os x ? __eou__
What about for Chromium ? __eou__
i would assume so , i was concerned more with what is coming across then my input __eou__

oh , good point __eou__ but if the decryption key is on the hard disk , what 's to stop you booting with a livecd then running the normal mount commands ? __eou__ it 's the same problem as DVD encryption __eou__ you can't lock down the content of a DVD with encryption , because you have to give someone the key to decrypt it so they can play it , right ? __eou__ so there 's no magic way to make the decryption key only decrypt to do the thing you want __eou__ there are a couple of hits on google for how to do it on other distros __eou__ try it with a machine you have physical access to __eou__ is it just /home that 's encrypted ? __eou__
even non dual booting .. but i consider it a danger zone either way __eou__ more dangerous dual , less dangerous single booting .. You have to expect problems while testing it __eou__ i've done hibernation in the past and never went back to it . Just be careful __eou__
you could check if you are running nscd and restart the service , but i dont recall if debian uses it or not __eou__
however , your script should not be installing things __eou__ What exactly are you trying to do ? __eou__
yep . it works but it stops and he read to me that the system asks ( as far as i can remotely understand ) for manually insert apt-get install -f __eou__ sorry the ' update manager ' asks for this command . i didnt confirm if now the system center works ? why , what to do ? __eou__
Yes , you just need to make it executable as a program , soman . __eou__
i want that when i turn on pc that all disks are mounted __eou__

ok , thx __eou__ seems to work __eou__ well i think it 's just that site : http://interactivepython.org __eou__
any lines starting with " EE "? __eou__
You could pastebin it , too . __eou__
open a terminal type " lspci " ( lowercase L ) no quotes , and hit enter . find the audio line , and tell me exactly what it says ( **unknown** copy'paste the whole list here ) __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
yes , which only people with experience know how to look at __eou__
not sure how you got there , or why ... __eou__
I'd just create a new user and use that one . __eou__
thanks , but I was hoping for a desktop-environment-agnostic solution . I'm working with ubuntu server =) __eou__
Unfortunately not ... __eou__
ah . thanks for the info . __eou__
With passwd __eou__ It wasn't blank __eou__
Well , You CANNOT execute a TEXT file . __eou__
can i install spotlight ( which is in mac ) in ubuntu __eou__
what you mean ? __eou__
i installed beep package a few mins back . I dont know how to use that cmd . __eou__
going into D ? __eou__
how do i do it ? __eou__
OpenVZ when compared to virtualbox ? __eou__
how did you mount it ? __eou__
problem is that both palyer us different unit measures __eou__
To which problem ? Suspending saves even more power than a screensaver . Green IT , you know ? __eou__ Well , just call me lucky to not mess with burnins then . __eou__
Everytime I want to watch a video I have to disable the **unknown** power saving settings ? __eou__
I see __eou__ at the time of installation , it asks to agree on T&C which says Personal Use __eou__
Not from the song . from the flag :) __eou__
you're in another channel I'm in as jacksparr but I can't think which one __eou__ #archlinux ? __eou__
they state that I have root access to the mysql server . __eou__
thanks im not crazy :) __eou__
if you can't log into it with mysql -u root -p and then your password at the prompt , then they haven't set it up right __eou__ or they're not giving you the right credentials __eou__
I was trying to ask two questions in one . __eou__
please don't use loud away messages , use /away if necessary __eou__
I wouldn't say it was advertised like that __eou__
**unknown** : I am getting this error mysqldump : Got error : 1045 : Access denied for user ' **unknown** ' ( using password : YES ) when trying to connect __eou__ I am getting this error : mysqldump : Got error : 1045 : Access denied for user ' **unknown** ' ( using password : NO ) when trying to connect __eou__
whas is release prompt ? __eou__ I **unknown** see any such parameter there __eou__ thanks , that info you provided was enough for finding /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades __eou__
deb give us the url __eou__
no , not in nautilus , in the window manager itself ? __eou__
Thanks :) __eou__
sorry , that 's probably too advanced for me to answer . __eou__
If you still only see Firefox 15 , open the Settings>Repositories menu item and look at the mirror settings and their locations . __eou__
chsh , but I'm not sure what you mean by purple ? __eou__
been there , done that , even purged it and re-installed it ... __eou__
When I do that , I get an error that says you'll need a computer that has Windows , Mac , or Chrome OS . __eou__ I'm with ikonia , show us a screenshot , or it didn't happen . __eou__
yes , but normally there 's a wpa_supplicant . conf file , but don't konw how this is dealt in ubuntu __eou__
out of curiosity , isn't that slower ? I did that too on my computer __eou__
Okay . You're on the partition screen right now and were confused a little bit I guess ? Here is why I said what I did : /home is where your user files go ( videos , music , config files blah blah) . If you put it on its own partition you can do a clean install when the next version comes out and keep your same /home partition . Does that make sense at all ? __eou__
well , he won't respond after making that statment ..... so __eou__
i dont know what exactly do you mean . __eou__
they will run email client , office and browser __eou__
will you use LTSP ? __eou__ and since your clients don't run a linux distro , you run a server only . NOT lubuntu but ubuntu server or any other Linux server distro __eou__
any other OS on the disk , or just ubuntu ? __eou__
I've stepped back because I apparently don't understand LTE :) __eou__
Thanks for helping , its mainly the desktop and the window appearances i am trying to theme __eou__
buffers not counted , on my computer which has 12GB ram __eou__
Hmm , that should work . If it worked OK on 12.04 then you might need a 3.5 . **unknown** kernel __eou__
firefox ... hahaha ... at least use chromium __eou__
see if you see the device in network manager __eou__
cause you run the spanish inquisition on him , complete with the comfy chair :) __eou__
So is there any option for saving power and life span for members of **unknown** ? The server runs 24/7 but is only access once every 6-12 hours . __eou__ Thanks __eou__
No , not a personal IP . But an IP , since it uses IP networking . __eou__
aha I thought you meant alias __eou__ Then I'm sorry I don't know __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ is there a way i can just disable grub completely and still get into ubuntu to turn it back on ? like for a single startup or something ? __eou__ woot : sall good . just lame that what should work never does lol __eou__
It 's not userland anymore , it 's mainstream kernel . :/ __eou__
modern disks record using something similar to QAM like you use for digital TV __eou__ modern disks haven't been able to do this for 20 years or so __eou__
I can't figure out how to run it __eou__
thanks . I am going to do multiple overwrites . I use " shred " now for files/folders ......... __eou__
license ? you joking .. using ssh is open __eou__
Context :) __eou__
rsh can execute program on the computer ? __eou__
that would be great if you could provide it __eou__
I have installed inetd and inetutils-inetd . __eou__ I meant I have installed inetutils-inetd and **unknown** . __eou__ how do I check it telnetd is running ? __eou__
only the spare is found - game over . __eou__
No . It will just be mounted to a specific mountpoint - always . __eou__
bekks True . It 's a while since any of my arrays went south __eou__
kostkon : __eou__
that would remove it , then you use sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdc __eou__ it seems both your disks of md2 are considered as spare units , so its not even recognized as a degraded raid - either your **unknown** raid confi lacked the redundancy or something else went compeltely wrong . my bet is you wont be able to fix anything here and its time to grasp for the backups __eou__
if it 's a fresh installation , give sudo apt-get autoclean first __eou__
Thanks :) __eou__
I want to see how telnet works . I didn't the configuring . Set up inetd , removed the commented telnetd line from /etc/inetd . conf . __eou__
yes i am here __eou__
Only empirically . It definitely feels much hotter in ubuntu than in Win7 to my hand . I doubt it 's hardware because it works perfectly fine and is reasonably cool in Win7 . Is there a command I can run to get the CPU temp ? __eou__
yes . __eou__
where is the options button ? __eou__
yes iam trying to compile the driver for **unknown** : 8176 Realtek Semiconductor Corp . RTL8188CUS 802.11 n WLAN , which i downloaded , install kernel source , gcc but still got the error , jold on let me pastebin the error messages __eou__ http://pastie.org/5059018 __eou__ am i missing something ? __eou__ sorry i was disconnected did you get my pastebin link ? __eou__
but clearly you wouldnt configure a router over telnet over an active network XD __eou__
It 's slow , but safe . :) __eou__
sorry i got DC'ed. if you posted a reply i didn't see it __eou__
i think it is hard because you have to basically recreate some scripts __eou__
Thank you So much ! Muchisimas gracias !, me has ayudado enormemente :D __eou__
i did never say " no routers support ssh " or anything like that . just that plenty of so called enterprise systems are still using ONLY telnet , while others ( extreme networks eg ) require a special license to enable ssh . no more no less , and thats a fact . __eou__ if you run this kind of hardware you'd of course run a seperated management vlan or such __eou__ jagginess : just google " extreme networks ssh license " and find tons of info .... __eou__
I don't know much about telnetd or telnet but that 's only because there isn't much information on the web . __eou__
yes old hardware __eou__
" Rather than invoking init scripts through **unknown** **unknown** , use the **unknown** ) " __eou__ utility , e.g. service ssh start __eou__ Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an __eou__ Upstart job , you may also use the **unknown** ) utility , e.g. start ssh __eou__ the whole message error log . __eou__
I figured I would need a switch of some sort . Oh well , yeah synergy is awesome . __eou__ Thanks __eou__
nice __eou__
nothin ... __eou__
look at the launchpad page where you got that link from and take a look if they have a own page or if the maintainers put an irc nick into their profile __eou__
firefox 12.04 __eou__
I did __eou__ :( __eou__ **unknown** :/ # __eou__ im in root __eou__ now __eou__
? __eou__
because that 's how cron works . Your jobs aren't run in the same environment your user has after a login . You should probably get rid of the -- silent and redirect stdout and stderr somewhere . You'll probably have a better idea of the issue __eou__
yes __eou__ could you pls start thinking ? i mean you have a server which could be hacked in a second and you dont know nothing . __eou__ the command from actionParsnip had a typo in it , which i corrected __eou__ all information is given , scroll up and read again __eou__ no need for wget __eou__ you got this file downloaded already __eou__
I am currently in terminal , I guess i'll restart - . - __eou__ for future reference , ctrl alt f1-f6 __eou__
yeah , it 's the update folder that 's not there __eou__
I've been using the nvidia drivers installed by the additional drivers application for a few months now . I just booted up today to find that the driver is no longer installed , and when I try to install it , it cannot ( says to look at jockey . log ) __eou__ Seems kind of strange , and wondering if it lines up with the kernel update recently ? __eou__
wait its only $ 19.99 __eou__
your gonna ask me for details later anyway ... __eou__
Alright , so what isn't working is when you try to do administrative things ? __eou__
it 's supported , but the ubuntu repos don't support IPv6 and I don't have any IPv4 addresses available to connect __eou__
About the same , yeah . You could also make a shortcut , if it 's something you do regularly . __eou__
i can tell you that i was using windows 7 as recently as 2 days ago , and i've never had an issue . so i'd have to assume it 's a driver issue . btw , i only just made the switch from windows to linux . you're dealing with a total newb here > . < __eou__
http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/admin/apt __eou__
mkpasswd seems to be light on punctuation __eou__
maybe a virtualbox install would work for you . __eou__
Thanks DaemonicApathy , I'll give that a try and get back . __eou__ Thankyou , I see I have a lot to learn about dpkg . I was unaware that command existed . I was also unaware of the paste.ubuntu.com . __eou__
yup , i use kde on one of my boxes . __eou__ haha __eou__
I'll recreate it and print the output in a second . __eou__
I thought I had , so I went and double checked . There are indeed no options in system-config-printer for choosing **unknown** . __eou__
i did but synpatic continues with BIG fonts __eou__
long time since I installed ubuntu , so I don't know the specifics . can't you create a partition ? __eou__
I already answered your dumb question . Read it properly again . __eou__ american ? __eou__
why not simply change your Mac address to whatever , download the torrent , then change it back ? Does it have to mimic another computer on the network ? __eou__
great __eou__
there 's also " dmidecode " but not sure if will work on Ubuntu __eou__ there 's a manufacturer and part model ( if it can decode it properly ) __eou__ it will at least tell you the precise quantity info , otherwise you can always fish the motherboard model and look at the specs on their websites .... all depends what you re trying to do __eou__
thank you __eou__
Buy an android < 3 then install Ubuntu on it , then you will be within topic again :) __eou__
if one program shows it properly , and another doesn't, I'd ask in the channel for the program that doesn't work right . __eou__
I'm afraid that 's up to the processes themselves , not the init scripts . For example , MySQL has its own user system . __eou__
somsip , what 's the difference between the x-terminal that already exists ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
somsip , what 's the difference between the x-terminal that already exists ? __eou__
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/ubuntu/point/dev/ __eou__
thanks __eou__
Good luck . I've no idea if it depends on newer kdelibs or so . 12.10 wont be long tho ;) __eou__
annotations mostly , text marking . simple drawing would be nice . __eou__
me too , but as you said : were a handfull of people __eou__
I gave unity a couple of weeks , and looked for others . Awesome was my choice . Each to their own . OT __eou__
will i have to unsquash it in read-only mode ? __eou__
i run du -ah | sort -n -r | head -n 20 , all i get is very few 1M files __eou__
i did that on root __eou__
thanks __eou__ yes , and there is a _much_ more recent version for gentoo and even more recent git version . The changes are quite heavily __eou__
have you looked at puppet , or clusterssh ? __eou__
aha ! that may be the case . can I detect such a file already open by the process ? perhaps list open files ? can I also find out its size ? __eou__
here 's my script __eou__ http://pastebin.com/0Z5HTUQC __eou__ yeah , i want to ssh into each and trigger a restart __eou__ cool . did not know that existed __eou__ i'll look into clusterssh __eou__
thanks __eou__
is there a more accurate way to measure free disk ? __eou__
thanx , thats not quite the question __eou__
no idea .. maybe the kernel thinks there 's a ghost file but i can't see it on disk ? __eou__
Okay ... how do I do that ? __eou__ log , loop0 through loop7 and loop-control __eou__
yeah , but for serious cloud storage you cannot rely on ubuntu to encrypt your data . __eou__
the then needs to be before the rm line __eou__ http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-6.html __eou__
Will not create swap . Have 16GB __eou__
log , loop0 through loop7 and loop-control __eou__
Therefore I want to choose dmcrypt because my CPU supports AES_NI and it is rather fast in general __eou__
i have no idea :D just tried the " beep " command and heard nothing so i assumed i have no spkr __eou__
ubuntu won't grant root privileges to guest accounts __eou__
dosnt work either __eou__
i don't know what you are talking about , sincerely , my ubuntu works properly and i don't use windows , i don't know what is going on __eou__
just running beep is enough for me . It beeps __eou__ the only thing I did was to load pcspkr , but as you said you already have ... __eou__ maybe check if it is managed through alsamixer __eou__ but if you cant find a way to make it work you could use mplayer with some mp3 __eou__ i can't think of a reason it shouldn't work , but still i cant think of one why it doesn't __eou__
I am new to linux . I read man pages , but i didnt get any thing . what i understood is its giving some options in man pages __eou__
su : Authentication failure __eou__
thank you , i'll check it __eou__
usually one uses kernel-package and I dounno how kgdb is activated ( won't you need a kernel patch ? ) but you can est your own gcc options of course when you run it __eou__
ahh , thanks __eou__
from within the chroot or from outside ? __eou__
there 's also #ubuntu-server __eou__
so i would have to chroot , then mount the rest of the system , except that folder that I want to fake . __eou__
well , i don't want to change the root . __eou__ more like change this directory **unknown** to point to **unknown** for this process only . __eou__
okay __eou__
the last tim i tried , was this solution > http://blog.mbirgin.com/?c=page&ID=326&t=howtoinstallmoonlightsilverlightonubuntu but it doesn't work , i cannot find docs about moonlight stopping support for FF/Chrome __eou__
I've just asked Launchpad to build a Quantal version . __eou__
sorry about that , I ain't going to be* ;) __eou__
the output of lsusb is empty ? __eou__
ok , i'll try __eou__
it 's not supported here . __eou__
THanks for clearing that up . **unknown** . __eou__
dualbooting 12.04 and wheezy , had to shrink the 12.04 partition __eou__
yes __eou__
and Wols I just want to make sure my network is not having a problem 3 of my guys spent the entire weekend trying to figure this out and were quite pissed off because we went through a lot of trouble to make sure our lab did not have any PROXY in its path __eou__
in the package manager , yes __eou__ michealPW lets get back on topic please __eou__
no . apt-get prints errors to stderr . so use 2 > __eou__
thats it , thanks :) __eou__

my " wives " are fat ascii 's one weighs 2435 lbs __eou__ the netsplit is scrolling the screen can i just message you direct __eou__
thanks __eou__
I think you mean upgrade , clone the original in case the upgrade breaks will be your best insurance . __eou__
should I upload a screenshot ?! __eou__ the problem is that my english is not so good : | __eou__
hm . I was instructed to use " grub-install ". When I try , though , it says " grub-install : not found ". THere *IS* a " grub-installer ". Same thing ? __eou__ ok , thanks ! __eou__
stick with live then __eou__
Ok , thanks . Will123467 Must have missed that :-( __eou__ I'm at that ctrl-alt-f2 console , about to ' grub-install ' -- I've partitioned/configured a *separate* " /boot " partition on the HD , @ /dev/sdb1 . Should it be " grub-install /dev/sdb " or " grub-install /dev/sdb1 "? __eou__
ok cool thanks __eou__
So ? __eou__
ah , thanks __eou__
12.10 in #ubuntu+1 please __eou__ using what desktop ? __eou__ classic has some super . alt . shift . right click combo i recall .. __eou__
ok I'll try that . I have not been able to reproduce the issue at will so I cant test it right away __eou__ I did just try a manual suspend and the computer behaved a little different from my issue . the mouse woke it up and the keyboard/mouse worked fine , but in addition to that the fan(in the desktop ) turned off or at least went quite . I am not really sure what to make of that __eou__
true , but basically Id rather not have to " recover " my data and copy it somewhere else etc . Ideally I could just reset the login phrase __eou__
the one you get when you boot the install CD __eou__ oh , hang on , did you go into " Install Ubuntu " rather than " Try without installing "? __eou__
It seems to be totaly unresponsive when I log-in , then throws up errors but since it 's unresponsive I can't really read them or submit their reports etc . __eou__
They never come to projects , I generally have never heard of a black person using Ubuntu __eou__
no choice __eou__
Thanks ! __eou__
thanks i will try __eou__
how many packages are now listed in the update manager ? __eou__
i'm trying to upgrade 12.04 to 12.10 now . __eou__
Even if you pull it out ? :) __eou__
' whats seen ?' __eou__
no GDebi is a graphical installer for . deb files __eou__ no prob ! __eou__
Varies on your kernel , but : apt-cache policy linux-headers-$(uname -r ) should say __eou__
thank you , I will if i get to that point . I'm going to check my backups first then return . __eou__
i've never used wubi __eou__
thanks __eou__
okay sorry __eou__
lol __eou__ ! repeat __eou__ ty k1l __eou__ their installation manual is a bit weird : http://owncloud.org/support/install/ I dont even have the folder install or data __eou__
Would you know how ? __eou__
Its just a text file . I don't think it 's a symlink __eou__
it wasn't possible to to find the name for the group ID 1001 __eou__
NO idea what launcher you are refering to ... __eou__ look in the . desktop file of your launcher __eou__ id just use the normal wine , and not use playonlinux __eou__ no you do not . __eou__ i never use playon linux , and i install the steam client all the time __eou__ install wine , then ' wine whatever . exe ' __eou__ if you did not have wine installed .. makes me wonder what play on linux was trying to launch ... __eou__
or that , thanks __eou__
Well , you guys are smart . You might figure something out , I'm sure . __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
not heard of that either , sorry __eou__
for gdebi __eou__
^^ ill try installing that driver in a min , do you think it will work now that youve seen the error message in question ? __eou__ do i need to restart after installing that ? __eou__ how do i reload the desktop ? __eou__ how do i reload the desktop ? __eou__
**unknown** is a big hint there ... __eou__
no it 's not I think __eou__
then chown it to your user __eou__
im on lubuntu __eou__
what do you think I could do now ? __eou__
so you mean when it comes out the ubuntu will auto jump to the supported quantal ? __eou__
cool , so you understand the process then . __eou__
have you tried a different USB port ? __eou__
depends on config really __eou__ run : lsusb and use the 8 character hex ID to find guides __eou__
What would you recommend for programming that will last me a while ... __eou__
thanks . __eou__
details ? __eou__ alrite . already 5 hrs wasted today ... lets hope 11.10 works @@ __eou__ or do you think i should jump down to the last LTS __eou__
Yes I downloaded a file actionParsnip and it ; s saved __eou__ yes __eou__
did the file download ? __eou__ run the whole command and you willmake a URL when you select to upload to the server __eou__ yes , its an alsa script to be ran , then select to upload to the server __eou__ use cursors to navigate the menus __eou__
Grub is a badass bootloader , the Windows one isn't nearly so great __eou__
i was just reading up on BSD ... seems to be what most choose __eou__
hmmm ... I only have the one package installed ( " dropbox " 1.4 . 0 ) __eou__ ah . gotcha . then I'll bow out of trying to help , ' cause I sometimes get equally confused . ;) __eou__
fyi , if i don't know what a package is called , i use " apt-cache search foo " from cli ( fyi , no sudo required ) __eou__
you need to go to the server irc.spotchat.org __eou__
actionParsnip is trying to make a very simple point ... __eou__
I mean , for example -- > Dropbox is installed by downloading it through the site and then running it as an executable . But you can't normally uninstall it via the app store , you have to .. iono do it through terminal or synaptic ( which sometimes confuses me) . __eou__
its supported only bu community , its not officially supported __eou__
doesn't it show on the top panel ? __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1282373/ but last time im sure the update number was higher __eou__

no ... __eou__
assuming ufraw is the maximized window , and geeqie is the smaller one , I would say geeqie still has some work to do on the brightness settings during conversion . I notice they still are not in a ' stable ' release . __eou__
that is the message from shell __eou__ I know the basics of debugging a problem , and that 's not working . __eou__
nice man thanks . I was just getting to where gconf is being replaced by gsettings __eou__
My system crashed couple days ago . I had to do hard reboot . I somehow screwed up some settings trying to get rid of unity in ccsm . __eou__

yeah , but i'm kinda crummy at using them ... __eou__
yeah i guess I'll ask there and see if I get a response tomorrow __eou__
ah alright , i wasnt sure __eou__
ask the question __eou__
you got the same error , no such process or whatver ? __eou__
blackshirt , thanks ! __eou__
I tried but still its not workin __eou__
cfhowlett i must have confused it with other distro .. okay then .. __eou__
You're all set for 64-bit OSes , so all I can think of is that the available drivers for the mouse are only optimized for x86 . does the touchpad work alright ? __eou__
Tends to have glitches . VWmare is flawless . __eou__
about **unknown** .. __eou__
Was quiet slow . __eou__
when it is used by default then it is considered stable ( unless explicitly stated otherwise ) __eou__
please learn to read channel names . thank you __eou__

Yes __eou__ I need to know how to get Remmina to use my wireless instead of the wired connection so it will be on a seperate network __eou__
awesome . __eou__
Right , monolithic Display Managers like GDM or KDM have built-in greeters . LightDM does not , it has extensible greeters . __eou__

yes , thank you ... but i cannot figure how to use that to make a udev rule ... i know how with this parameter ... would this do the job : __eou__ or is it just one equal sign ? __eou__
I am cloning a Compactflash image on a new CF and installing grub at last __eou__
it 's a university thing , I need to it for my final year project __eou__ basically , you feed it a bigraph and some reaction rules and it checks to see if certain conditions are met __eou__ I doubt there 's anything wrong with bigmc , it 's just my environment that is probalby wrong __eou__
was just about to do that , second __eou__

Sorry , it 's apt-cache showpkg nodejs __eou__
ANSI escape codes are used to move the cursor around the screen to allow you to draw anywhere on the terminal . dumb terminals and Emacs shell buffers do not support ANSI escape sequences and they don't make sense without a controlling terminal . In those situations the program is nice enough to fall back on a line-by-line interface implemented using the GNU readline library . __eou__
digital is better ... and either on or off . Volume is handled at the receiver . __eou__

just looking ballpark , I thought maybe 40 min , but its going on 2 hours .... not sure when to say " something not right " __eou__
thank you very much ! __eou__
but I would also like to know if something is wrong too . All I seen is blinking hdd lights for 3 hours+ __eou__ its a quad core 2.4 G __eou__
okay , I'll ask there ( I didn't realize it was 12.10 specific) . __eou__
Well , there probably is a way , but it 's gonna use CCSM ( and everyone should know how dangerous CCSM is ) __eou__
well the main issue is that the list would be very long unless you were only interested in specific packages __eou__
and over time , many packages change names too even when they still do the same things __eou__
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave __eou__ Instead of asking of possibilities you don't describe , give your final gaol . __eou__ I see avidemux the web for this sort of thing , personally I have no idea . __eou__ Now raise your right hand and swear this is not another **unknown** . ;) __eou__
ur familiar with manual compiling java ? __eou__
that doesn't explain why you would want to run it at all __eou__ the debconf script is always run automatically __eou__
well , say gpg for example . i believe the version is different on 12.04 as from 10.04 and would just like to compare them __eou__
Yes , there are 1719 people here , someone may know __eou__
dude dont say that to mee everyone us doing it too __eou__
Guitar Pro 6 __eou__
yeah in the display settings __eou__
That 's because mount follows the symlink and displays the device name , if you " cat /proc/mounts " ( which comes from the kernel ) you will probably see that /dev/disk/by-uuid/foo is what was mounted . __eou__ The /dev/disk/by-uuid/ namespace by its nature cannot handle one UUID symlink pointing to two different devices , and it 's entirely possible for the symlink to change as devices come and go . __eou__
I agree __eou__
ye , it 's all setup and I've installed both ways ( through repositories and off dropbox itself ) __eou__
yeah ... i'm using classic :) __eou__ no likey unity __eou__
well by that time my stream is messed up ... i just stop __eou__ i'm trying to do it 24/7 but can't cause it will idle :( __eou__
no .. I dont know why . I installed __eou__ and it shows two different ones __eou__ it might be two diff ubuntu . 11 and 12.04 __eou__
what ubuntu version are you using ( " lsb_release -sc " from terminal if unsure) ? could you still be using grub1 ( aka grub-legacy) ? __eou__
please be careful about confronting me as i am crazy __eou__
i did __eou__
thx for the info ... i had few doubt about that anyway ... Could be an idea ( not easy to implement i can understand ) to enable the contrary ... __eou__

If ddrescue recovers everything , then your data is probably safe ( be sure to fsck after recovery) . If it doesn ' then there is a chance that some files will be corrupt . __eou__

Ah , well , that 's a completely seperate issue then ! I see , I'm on the right page now ;) __eou__
no i don't __eou__ thank you for your help as well __eou__
ubuntu doesn't have an MTA by default . " 1 * * * * " will only on the first minute of every hour __eou__
it 's not xorg __eou__ I'm not seeing any signs of xorg killing it __eou__ you might try reinstalling xfce4-session __eou__
i was afraid of that __eou__ i think i found the source of the problem __eou__ when installing arch it told me something about error ill need to manually run mkcpio or something , i never did and while adding a custom grub entry i noticed i could not find initram or vmlinuz __eou__
no sorry i have no clue __eou__
it says command not found __eou__ I typed in gnome-display-properties and it said command not found ... is that bad ? __eou__
Alright , never mind . :-) __eou__
It asks for password __eou__

12.04 ran the proccy at 96% doing nothing . __eou__
It could be that a CLI installation could provide more information __eou__
I would strongly consider installing this via the command line __eou__ to get a better idea of what exactly is going on __eou__
if I install the wrong one could it crash my system . best i can figure , xserver-xorg-video-intel **unknown** . 20.9 **unknown** 2.20 . **unknown** is the one I need __eou__

we can't trust that you aren't just saying it 's the same under the absurd pretext that you think it will magically make it something we can help with . __eou__
be constructive or be quiet ;-) __eou__ fwiw I've been running 12.10 for a couple of months now , and it 's pretty good __eou__
using an FTP client in SFTP mode will still encrypt traffic , right ? __eou__
I'm not really sure __eou__
run " sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade " in a terminal to make sure . If there are any significant updates , it'll ask you to confirm __eou__
yeah , or something ... martimus is trying to change filemanagers __eou__
I don't see the issue . Mint is based of ubuntu and I bet if I tell you my problem , you'd be able to at least point me to the right direction . __eou__

hi nicekiwi thanks but from the name its a talking about mounting would I need to mount it then format as ntfs ( its a brand new harddrive ) __eou__
it does that to me sometimes too , only reboot fixes it . so i kinda gave up with gnome-shell .. unity is just so much more stable __eou__
from the top rh menu drop down the suspend should change to shutdown when you use the alt button __eou__
use zgrep if you want to search in zipped files - binary should be searched aswell __eou__
no further info about the conflict ? __eou__ try apt-get install ia32-libs __eou__ look at that page gain under " Troubleshooting Ubuntu " __eou__ otherwise this one might help http://www.misfitgeek.com/2012/03/how-to-set-up-ubuntu-linux-for-android-development/ __eou__
so I should just try to reinstall you mean ubuntu-desktop ? __eou__
that is very unlikely :) __eou__
i dont know exactly , i know i have no sound . __eou__
yes nothing muted __eou__
thanks , answer was in the same minute , that 's all I wanted to prove :) __eou__
i resently upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 . I followed your process . So that why i am asking you __eou__
no problem __eou__
at first it doesn't show up . If I unplug power supply , I have to do the following : Replug in , reboot because plugging monitor back in doesn't show up , even if I click Detect Displays . Upon reboot , I login to the OS , then I have to plug in the monitor , sometimes that works . Others , I have to close the lid , open it a couple times for the monitor to get picked up . __eou__

I've installed YaCy - and I'm trying to access the configuration pages on localhost - I can't do this remotely . __eou__
not necesarily .. updates / upgrades are there for a reason to fix things __eou__
I'll write tests-cases to check this , so extra-functionalities are of no use ... __eou__
tks for that , that is the best way to upgrade a distro ? __eou__
don't care how many times it was , hence why I'm asking you not to do it . **unknown** if you want help - it 's better to explain the problem to get help , rather than make pointless comments __eou__
unity has some numpad-mouse feature i recall __eou__
12.04 x64 precise __eou__ will you help me ? __eou__ i am using switchable amd gpu + intel gpu and set them switchable correcly . if i install latest intel driver will hybrid switchable system work again ? __eou__

how did you install Ubuntu ? Did you use Wubi ? __eou__
use a pastebin for multiple lines please __eou__
It 's not officially supported by Canonical , but other than that it should work fine . __eou__ Don't worry , it 's easy to reset Unity settings : unity -- reset __eou__ Nothing can really harm the system as long as it doesn't have root access . Also , nothing in the repos ever will harm the system . Canonical checks all the official packages for insecurities , for sure __eou__ I *think* it does . __eou__ Sorry , I'm a KDE person so I don't remember that stuff too well __eou__
Well , in either case fstab requires to have complete address for mount point . I see that when I mount a partition from external HDD it mounts as **unknown** ) - so instead of typing the whole path for each partitions , I'd like to have it auto so that it mounts as it normally would __eou__

in nautilus __eou__ can you take a screen shot of what you are seeing __eou__ so the back error should take you back or " up " a level __eou__ I'd suggest not installing dolphin __eou__
i just dont know what the look is called like __eou__
Not even sure what that is __eou__ You can use ppa-purge to remove PPAs and simply use apt-get to remove software __eou__ Oh , good to hear __eou__
dpkg -l | grep -i ubuntu-desktop says no __eou__
Well . If you totally *need* an updated version , try looking for a PPA . That 's all I can say . __eou__
i know but not good enough to change pointer speed according to my use __eou__ Its too Fast to move and control pointer not feeling like usable __eou__ can you assist me how to setup __eou__

you have to edit the rules file , as jrib pointed out , the . /configure step is basically worthless __eou__ are you on 12.04 ? __eou__ did you apt-get source the libdevil1c2 package or the dev package __eou__ you need to cd into the devil folder than gets created , then into the debian folder , there 's a rules file in there that has sse3 enabled by default __eou__
that makes sense :/ __eou__
oh ok :) __eou__

I am not very familiar with gnome 3 ... I know that Unity uses compiz and installing things like the compiz manager/various components break it . __eou__ someone more familiar with gnome 3 should answer that . Just be patient . __eou__

is there anyway I can force it to reinstall the amd64 ubuntu-desktop without referencing the other stuff ? __eou__
have you tried ubuntu ? __eou__ have you tried file-> save ? __eou__
' remove', not ' uninstall'? __eou__
I thought it would be able to be used for either 32 or 64 bit . but indeed it 's 32-bit only __eou__
that 's 2 nil to me . I'll stop while I'm ahead . Point taken __eou__

caaches ned syncing and the OS needs to forget the device before it can be physically removed __eou__ If you have bad sectors then the device is dying , probably due to not being unmouted correctly or other things __eou__ it 's only 1.5 Gb so no huge loss really ( didn't know they made 1.5 Gb drive that span ) __eou__
if you don't use dhcp on the router , the router cannot know the static hostnames of those clients __eou__

I managed to solved my problem ! this is the right command to use ! http://dpaste.com/815029/ I have to add the -- **unknown** option since I didn't use encription when creating the backup first __eou__ thank you so much , cheers __eou__
I can't even ... __eou__ You need to invent a computer which runs without electricity __eou__

You can create " **unknown** " and add specific variables to it which will be used by that script to set " search " __eou__

check your x logs to see what driver is being used now __eou__
I had 2 empty disks . I installed windows in 1 , then linux in the other __eou__
pffff ...... __eou__
oh .. ok __eou__
in twinview mode , the monitor extends the desktop . You may change the relative position and/or overlay them . Drag windows to make them show at the other monitor . __eou__ you may also clone the monitors ( useful for presentations with a beamer ) __eou__
If I do that and then close the terminal the application closes to . __eou__
so if she likes the gnome way of using things , personalize gnome fallback for her , or use cinnamon __eou__
thanks for helping . __eou__
That 's a nice service . __eou__ I'll try it . __eou__ thanks . __eou__
i dont know , i checked , its 16 GB including drivers , libreoffice , firefox , gimp2 __eou__
sure , but new features need more RAM . no way around that __eou__ I would wait around 1 maybe 2 months before considering to upgrade to a new ubuntu release . they need the time to fix their bugs __eou__
state your actual problem instead of asking useless " anyone has ..." questions which waste people 's time __eou__
repo has 3.7 but i want to install 4.1 __eou__
my \windows alone uses 27GB I think . then add pagefile , c :\ programs etc . remember : windows " solved " DLL hell by keeping ALL dlls it ever encounters forever and using hardlinks . typically awful MSFT " solution " to a problem . the end result is that \windows always , always increases it 's size on disk __eou__
can you suggest me some url which i can refer to for writing the launcher __eou__
No , when 10.04 LTS will not be supported anymore . __eou__
there is no such JRE . the important part is : openjdk or oracle __eou__
haha __eou__
500 GB __eou__
well if network manager is working , stick with it __eou__
do you mean after the crash occurs or upon reboot ? __eou__
look in ~/ . config __eou__
none for you to rant and name call in __eou__
using ' nmap ' would be 1 method __eou__ which is available for both : osx and linux . never heard of ' ting ' or something similar on osx __eou__
that should be no problem __eou__
does it work properly if I'm going to install it ... you said : install one ... so are there more than one xscreensaver to install __eou__
really ? ok __eou__
android or iOS then xD __eou__
yep that 's what I thought ... is there any possibility of getting torrent file becuase I can't download it from offical website __eou__
the current problem regarding ndiswrapper is allready well documented on the bug reporting system of launchpad __eou__
alright . use sudo lspci -k then __eou__
nope . But i have a hope in that __eou__ it 's impossible ?.. __eou__
what version of headset you have ? __eou__ try turning it off and back on and then search again > sometimes you have to remove and pair it again __eou__

I'm going to make a clean install so I would just tell the installer to chose the SSD , that should do trick or ? __eou__
set to chmod 777 __eou__
quick inquiry , after copying , will it allocate only the space on the old drive and then other remaining space as unallocated ? __eou__
WHEN there is a release , you should be able to sudo do-release-upgrade I believe __eou__
not that that ever is 100% , but its helpful :) __eou__
mac has problems , windows has problems , unbuntu has problems __eou__
I've been using it for a long time .... __eou__
trying that it wont off __eou__ trying that it wont off __eou__
**unknown** installed HPLIP 3.12 . 10 __eou__
thanks I'll check it out __eou__ wow that 's pricey , and I didn't see rendering as a feature __eou__
:o you think it 's file related ? mhm i'll check that out __eou__ really seems to depend on the file ... is there any way to " correct " the pdf so that it is properly printable ? __eou__
no , 21.10 is the current stable version __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/ there , 21.10 __eou__
thanks will try that __eou__ it worked , i am now upgrading to 12.10 :) __eou__
yeah __eou__ yess __eou__ yess why ?? __eou__
oh , nice . That might save the day for me . Know of any guide to help me through the process ? __eou__
you can use echo or ' here documents ' to echo the commands you want into the new file . __eou__
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity-2d/+bug/960469 found this one __eou__
yes , lsb_release -a __eou__
offtopic for that . __eou__ And DX099 sadly I only have a windows machine right here __eou__ I overloaded the universal usb filter though , should work . __eou__
have you run **unknown** sudo apt-get update **unknown** __eou__ pastebin your errors ( and the command you ran to get them) . Include a **unknown** sudo apt-get update **unknown** ifrst __eou__
i dont think i need to download it to my phone . ;) __eou__
But isn't that the problem ? __eou__
whist one is it ? __eou__
hmm , thanks , I never thought to look in the " change background " __eou__
yes , that will also install telepathy-haze , but also add icq as an option in the online accs , so yeah , install it . __eou__
alright I'll do that ( since the problem occures randomly I'll have to wait till it next happens again) . thanks __eou__
yes __eou__
gedit has a plugin that gives a markdown preview http://blog.philippklaus.de/blog/2011/06/26/markdown-for-the-gedit-text-editor-on-ubuntu-11-04/ __eou__ but I'm hunting for a vim like editor or plugin __eou__ found one for markdown but it is not working on my computer __eou__ https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown that is all I have found though :/ __eou__
also -- volume is buggy in vlc , which is what you are referring to i believe __eou__ im expecting a pulseaudio or alsamixer solution __eou__
I would until you are sure . ;) __eou__
i hear ya ... this is my work put too . maybe i really should wait __eou__
! fdisk | **unknown** __eou__ hhmmm , hmmm . __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
some bugs which annotiny me were fixed __eou__ wille-nilee : *which annoying __eou__
try DISPLAY= : 0 __eou__
I realize that , however the tab shows no available drivers , it 's greyed out __eou__
yes , it 's installed __eou__
you need to add or setup and account on an app that supports the messaging menu first for the envelope icon to appear , in 12.10 __eou__
Cool , I can't help here , but the channel works best with details , thanks . ;) __eou__
:) i got it __eou__
it should be fairly self evident . I would boot from scratch ... watch top ... and see if processes are chewing up more and more ram/cpu ( prob ram ) and figure out why . __eou__
you mean it 's pretty new ? __eou__
that is very wrong . I would look at syslog and dmesg log in /var/log and see if I could figure out why your desktop is crashing . __eou__
not sure what that means . The fact that it was up ... doesn't lead me to believe that it is the driver , but ... a quantal issue . I would look heavily through the logs to confirm that ... but that would be my where my blame was sniffing . __eou__
by all means update __eou__ if you get what you need out of the open drivers ... I am all for that hpram99 . __eou__
how do I check ? __eou__
thanks ! I'll try this . No idea how to do it but I'll find it __eou__
so it gives you the number of directories with spaces , and files too , right ? __eou__ what is the output without the part wc -l ? __eou__
losing data from a harddisk after a reboot ? __eou__
ah , thanks __eou__
what software , do you have any links to show how to to it ? : ) __eou__ ur a beast ! TY again :) __eou__
http://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/ __eou__ It says it works through WINE , but I want something native , if there is one . __eou__
how do I manually connect ? __eou__
Well I just want to know if it lets me select a partition __eou__
actually my connection seems fine . was thinking it was the ubuntu servers . but i guess if your download speed is fine , i dont know what the issue is __eou__
sorry , my bad . you where asking a follow up question ;) guess i should have addressed Endafy ( but that woulnd't have made any sense yet) . sorry man . __eou__
what can i type to see what jobs are ... ? __eou__
nice __eou__
thank you __eou__ how do i add something to the end of a boot line in grub2 ? i always forget about that __eou__
chromebooks ? I've owned one for 6 months ? now __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
of course you can install xfce4 if you want it ( sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop ) __eou__
ok , I'll make sure to avoid that one then __eou__
i suspected thats a problem __eou__ can you tell me which repo do i need to **unknown** __eou__
you wonder why people never use Linux , and especially after such a claim " avoid the headache of Windows 8 " this shit makes me sick __eou__
great , then I can replace that awful nouveau driver with a proper ( and sadly , proprietary ) driver __eou__
if you are an old user , you know how these things work in linux , sometimes . Also fedora isn't what you could call " rock solid " xD __eou__ just install it now then , what are you waiting for ? __eou__ you want gnome 3 ? you already have it . What you need is gnome-shell , ' sudo apt-get install gnome-shell ' __eou__
for servers its completely different . its about security and stability aswell as software compatibility . __eou__
I don't know :P I just pointed out that there are several __eou__
no problem man . :) __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
are you stuck at the screen ? __eou__ I can help you out if you want __eou__
ah , will do . __eou__ first , I have to solve that I apparently misspelled the / entry in /etc/fstab , and now has a / that is mounted readonly so I can't change /etc/fstab . ( **unknown** ) __eou__
this : **unknown** . so : ELF 64-bit LSB shared object , x86-64 , version 1 ( **unknown** , dynamically linked , stripped __eou__
how ? __eou__
yes , grub2 , add text to the boot line __eou__
we will rewrite xorg . conf after __eou__
I have no dash . nothing but desktop icons __eou__
im installing it on a intel dg33tl board and asus nvidia gt520 card __eou__
well .... i need to add nomodeset to it __eou__
no android here . best of luck . __eou__
- Thanks . Didnt spot that channel __eou__
ah ok , good to know __eou__
if you go into software sources , it has it 's own tab __eou__
its my next thing to play with , I've been testing Quantal since alpha 2 to get bugs reported etc __eou__
did you install the nvidia proprietary video driver ? __eou__
packages contain binaries . What are yout trying to install **unknown** __eou__
yeah __eou__ but I don't care about the kernel I cannot boot it ... __eou__ does anyone know a decent grub on a stick ? __eou__ *grub iso __eou__
perfect ! __eou__
No Queops . I reinstalled the headers , no solution __eou__
have you allowed it in both directions ? __eou__ I'd check the out too , covers the bases __eou__
don't understand __eou__ make the changes to file /etc/default/grub , update-grub < -- in terminal to make change __eou__
reinstall ? __eou__
the header package appears to be installed __eou__
yeah , you'd have to install it from scratch on either , starting from the desktop makes sense if you're using it interactively ; the server version 's interesting because of what it doesn't include , most people don't care for having things like a graphics stack or email client on their servers __eou__
that combination is always a pain ; you can set up a webserver of FTP server , but configuring them is hard and you have problems with your firewall and your router 's firewall __eou__
omfg __eou__
is there more information in the X log ? it 's at **unknown** . something IIRC __eou__
how many kernels do you have ? __eou__ you have to free some space on your boot partition , remove some old kernels if you have one __eou__
if you run the sound app , is the correct device set for sound output ? __eou__
Yes , the alternate CD had it in 12.04 , but the desktop cd doesn't in 12.10 . __eou__
Word .. I'll check out the installer from the repo , I usually just copy them to /usr/share/fonts/truetype and then fc-cache -fv but maybe something weird happened this time . __eou__
problems with my connection __eou__ good try but it doesn't reload group members __eou__
with or without x ? you could ' tail /var/log/syslog ' in terminal __eou__ you might also consider the issue is hardware related , try another usb keyboard/mouse to check __eou__
I'm currently running 8-9 VM 's on virtualbox __eou__ i want to provide my team of devs to provision their own test machines __eou__
you tell it what sort of persistence file to create in the startup disk creator , you can restart and just tell it not to if you want to __eou__
check pm at the top __eou__
alexfpms : that was my next option , i'll just skip straight to it . __eou__
you use that do-release-upgrade that people have been saying i belive __eou__ under privacy settings somewhere i recall . or you can remove the shopping lens __eou__ webupd8 has info on it __eou__
well are you connecting with wifi ? __eou__
write a shell script that contains your rsync **unknown** , then add the path to your crontab list __eou__ if grsync is worth its weight in salt as a program , you should be able to ask it for the rsync command it 's performing __eou__ you are correct , check out : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto __eou__
no idea . I rarely if ever upgrade to newer releases __eou__
yes __eou__ the server edition is cli __eou__
no idea __eou__
nothing that I know of . I just started with Grsync for the GUI since I am not very good at command line Linux . . . yet :-) __eou__
yeah but they will be missing for years to come __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
That link is broken , btw . __eou__ Sure , from an external machine , but a LiveUSB/DVD is easier . __eou__
You type in my name and your text turns red . __eou__
re GUI apps on a server - I can understand starting from Ubuntu Server to build a customised desktop but I can't think of any GUI apps at all that make sense on a server __eou__
whats that __eou__
yw serban __eou__ ! br | Guest31516 __eou__
found solution on that page : sudo update-initramfs -k all -u __eou__
what else could i be running to try to fix this ? if nothing , might as well __eou__
ah . thanks ! __eou__
if you config sudo for some limit command , you can't do it for your script __eou__
thanks so much ! __eou__
able to ssh to it and bluez is installed __eou__
you can check in tools-addons __eou__
since you never state what the actual problem is , no you can't :) __eou__
Precise is LTS anyway , so is supported past when quantal is EOL __eou__
then you need to narrow it a little __eou__
thanks , all done ! __eou__
you may need to change setting within it to upgrade only from LTS to any new releases __eou__
i told him to try that . one second __eou__ still says input not supported __eou__ We still can't get a GUI to work . :( __eou__
there is a PPA to move accounts into the gnome keyring __eou__
only one partition ? __eou__
never had a spark from a DE __eou__ gnome2 is dead __eou__ ask away __eou__ is that after you exit the game ? __eou__
I mean what is the COMMAND to start the script ? __eou__
echo " options snd-hda-intel model=thinkpad " | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe . **unknown** . conf > /dev/null __eou__
yeah but it seems that the only reason why ubuntu is going forward is because the devs are now taking it as a fulltime job and it 's paid with all those donations , shops , advertising __eou__
cool !! __eou__
lts should upgrade to non-lts 12.10 versions by default . something MUST be changed first . __eou__
i'll install another OS which deserves primary partition , and it 's issues with bootloader __eou__ i got it , thank you for response __eou__ should I create on primary extended partition and add /boot , / , swap over there into slices ? __eou__
do you use mplayer with medibuntu 's **unknown** or **unknown** ? that 's a real test ;) __eou__
what command gets my home folder permissions back ? __eou__
thanks for the help . I'm logging back in __eou__
driver updates might've caused that __eou__
Well , still no idea . I'm afraid I'm going to be useless to you today . __eou__
did I mention I am upgrading a server ? __eou__ when did I mention a server ? __eou__ I am upgrading my desktop pc __eou__
dont see it in the app __eou__ its not in the ubuntu software store __eou__
Evince doesnt have the functionality as Adobe has . I dont know any other . Can you recommend some ? __eou__
doh ... so sorry about this __eou__
results not showing up ? __eou__
that response doesn't help me in teh slightest __eou__
Yes , I still read " beta isos " __eou__
just remove the repositories it mention __eou__
thanks , will give it a shot __eou__
i checked there , the settings are the same as before i upgraded to 12.10 : v __eou__
that idk ; 3 __eou__
same here __eou__
It works quite well for some . __eou__
upgrade __eou__
Such an arrogance ! You shall be trapped by proprietary software hell . __eou__
ofc . I also deleted everything from the password manager bar my ssh keys , also didnt work __eou__
Will it install **unknown** automatically , or will it ask me what I want to install ? I don't want to go around apt removing all sorts of server packages . __eou__
ok , thanks for the help :) __eou__
ok i meant the newest LTS . __eou__
I'm using disk utility ! __eou__
they are miles away and don't allow file downloads :( __eou__
- GMA 3150 IS new in netbooks and 950 is old but they both are good enough for ubuntu or on small laptop __eou__
= thnx __eou__
speaking of which , any opinion on how big to make / vs /home partitions ? __eou__
yes , but needs user feedback , I need it to boot first , report later , and try to re-mount . __eou__
tell him what ? And , " him " is an assumption ;-) __eou__ how long is a piece of string ? __eou__ even with Linux there comes a point where it 's just easier to nuke and pave a system __eou__
Im new at ubuntu so still trying to figure things out __eou__
I scrolled up 4 pages and saw nothing . And I can't help you , sorry __eou__
somsip , ubottu . Thank you for all ! __eou__
I'm the ugly brother :) __eou__
But One of the new thing in 12.10 was webb apps ... isn't that what it was alla about ? __eou__
Try rebooting into recovery mode __eou__ Do you have more than one hard drive ? __eou__
if you do disable networked lenses , it _won't_ send anything anywhere , anyways __eou__ that 's just legal gibberish , not how it actually works __eou__
perhaps it has something to do with internet speed , once i am home i will try and do another upgrade then . __eou__
i already try that .. without the cd .. it does work .. __eou__ & blazemore : do you have any more suggestion that can I try ... __eou__
use a program called LiLi , and try it again . Format the USB and try a re-copy . I found that sometimes my live USBs do not install properly __eou__
looking at the results file , i don't see anyboot sector type/info for my linux partition __eou__
i will , thanks ! __eou__ i eventually succeeded ! thanks for your help . BTW : do you know of any graphic card which is completely supported by open source sw ? I don't mind any game application , I just need a good graphic card for desktop applications , with acceleration and 3d for unity __eou__
i already did that ... apart from sound indicator i am getting everything __eou__
Can a switch sout mp internet ? __eou__
now the same partition , but free space on that disk . I cancelled the installation before installing the boot , so at the moment I can perfectly boot w7 , but now linux __eou__

Unfortunately , can't reload the module with options because it 's got too many dependancies __eou__ Once the system is booted could not even rmmod __eou__
in this line ChrootDirectory /sftp/%u i change the /sftp/%u to whatever directory i want them to access right ? __eou__
' adduser test ' __eou__ with sudo ^^ sudo adduser test __eou__
In this case , it seems that it is at boot , 2 seconds in dmesg __eou__
the only argument against putting it in modprob **unknown** is if he needs the module loaded before init __eou__
wooooo :) __eou__
tahnks __eou__
Please mark yourself as affected by this bug : **unknown** If I figure out how to remove the stale signatures , or if there is a grub update which solves the problem without removing them , I'll add a comment to the bug report ( unless someone else does so before me) . __eou__ Did you seem my last message about the bug report ? __eou__ In the mean time , if you want a quick temporary work around you can boot your Ubuntu installation using Super GRUB2 Disk . __eou__
I tried . __eou__
what could possibly go wrong ? :P __eou__
Yes it 's google-chrome or chromium , the rest is the same :-) __eou__
you then choose the session you want at login . Also see this **unknown** __eou__

but proxying does not require the client to go to the Internet . __eou__

http://nixgeeks.com/how-to-enable-automatic-login-in-ubuntu-server/ __eou__ note the tty is the run level , and i believe just as the desktop the server boots you into tty 7 __eou__
yup __eou__ actully run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in the terminal __eou__
try sudo apt-get -f install __eou__
thanx ! im totally new with ubuntu !! __eou__
found it - forgot about the hidden tabs at the top - just use Home Folder and then File __eou__
Thanks , I will try that . __eou__
you don't, i'm afraid . unity-2d , that qt based interface , has been deprecated . __eou__ on low end systems or systems without 3d graphics card driver support , 12.10 uses part of the cpu to render unity . __eou__
this might help : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM#MD5SUM_on_Windows __eou__
i recall it not beign that hard to remove .. and i like the webapps feature . __eou__

ubuntu 12.04 comes with unity and I belive u can remove the repos for it but it messes with your system __eou__
I install fglrx fine using the additonal drivers . Whats not working for you ? __eou__
HTTP and FTP , can't ping , can connect from an iPod Touch 4th __eou__ any idea ? __eou__
try again with another computer or reboot your current one . __eou__
is there a way for me to update grub and not break it from withing linuxmint so that it fixes for 12.10 ? __eou__
yes . __eou__
slow opening apps , it 's laggy __eou__
ok thanks . I just tried it and give me en error protocol . : )) __eou__
yes , desktop working __eou__
right , appreciate your help , but being new to Linux I am not sure of what to do from here __eou__
sounds like all they did is change empathy to use an oauth-esque authentication so they don't store your passwrod . __eou__
" Note that installing preload will not make your system boot faster and that preload is a daemon that runs with root priviledges ." __eou__
well it won't get executed when your computer is shutdown __eou__
you're welcome ! :) __eou__
you tested it ? __eou__
it 's a non-gnu/linux native filesystem . it 's kinda like using NTFS ... __eou__
https://github.com/dajhorn/pkg-zfs/wiki/HOWTO-install-Ubuntu-to-a-Native-ZFS-Root-Filesystem __eou__
Does the netinst provide all the options the alternate iso did ? __eou__
is your wireless turned off ? Do you know how the Fn+wireless key works ? __eou__
im just runing ubuntu . the top download on flash was yum for linux . i dunno which i want __eou__
just an example :) __eou__
i did some changes and when i restart my machine and type my pass someone says it . it is i think text to speech __eou__
hm ok ... so what 's the best way to install the latest proprietary nvidia drivers now ? __eou__
veo que tienes problemas con los plugins __eou__
you are on 12.10 ? __eou__
read and follow the directions in the link bazhang called ubottu on you with . __eou__
how do i add video call support to empathy in ubuntu 12.10 64bit __eou__
yes , i guess __eou__ choose the " recommended " driver btw :P __eou__
PBR ? __eou__
' not working ' is a little vague , can you elaborate __eou__
as i said , if i remember right , you could try resetting unity . __eou__ http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-reset-compiz-and-unity-in-ubuntu.html __eou__ but if you have just upgraded , a reboot wouldn't harm __eou__
you mean like setup a directory that when you navigate into it it shows you the contents of the remote filesystem ? __eou__
**unknown** , I can't find it __eou__ I'm not on the machine that has it installed . __eou__
true , true __eou__
does that mean I have to use the free/open source driver for ATI ? __eou__
how you know that .. __eou__
i have acer too , works like a charm __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1289850/ __eou__
I mean have some way of viewing the steps in the various < type > script/end script blocks __eou__ say using **unknown** __eou__ but even logging would do __eou__
at which stage ? __eou__
it can run from either/or __eou__
Nope __eou__
well , it refers to old repo which relies on ubuntu release cycle principle , I want to upgrade directly but I forgot __eou__ Did 12.04 . 1 added new Intel KMS support for Optimus drivers , eh ? __eou__ do you know it ? it was like " sudo apt-get foobar -- upgrade " dunno exactly __eou__
snort **unknown** . gz ) __eou__
:P you can use a usb stick instead __eou__
no it 's specific to youtube-dl __eou__ btw yes , that 's the only program i know of that you should upgrade like that __eou__
12.04 . 1 __eou__
that **unknown** did not make sense with that answer __eou__
I've read some of them .... __eou__
lol i liked this update though , i had to install bumblebee to get ubuntu 3D work , but now it auto renders Intel driver so it loads without pain , good job =) __eou__
you're not signed in , if so __eou__
which directory do they usually end up in ? __eou__
well , I did have an issue with every kernel up until 3.2 . 0 not finding my raid ... __eou__ how would I check for that ? __eou__
how do I connect to my wireless hotspot ? I created the connection and now ?? __eou__
ye the remove part seemed to work thanks __eou__
old HP from **unknown** ... lol __eou__
i didn't know there are people working on Intel KMS support for linux , but maybe they emulated **unknown** code , ha ? __eou__
see above __eou__
The folks in #httpd are also available if you have more questions . __eou__
that 's not why I asked this __eou__ ther eis no point rebooting unless the firmware file is there . so one should check __eou__
yes , i press ESC at the bios POST screen to choose the CDROM as the boot device but it apparently does not find anything bootable on it __eou__
It 's a bug that needs reporting . It 's not a problem that could be easily fixed by a **unknown** ? __eou__ Sorry don't know why I put a question mark there :) __eou__
the device I'm trying to install on has 512MB RAM and 20GB HD perhaps the isntaller is running out of RAM with the **unknown** ? How do I get this mini CD net install ? __eou__
You can have them on the left or right . __eou__
while I appreciate your conviction in my ability to stick around here and complain , I think I'll just go back to Kubuntu . I've had enough of XChat marking the words " I've " and " doesn't " as typos anyway . ^_^ __eou__
Is there a way for bumblebee to tell you ? __eou__
:P __eou__ Do you understand why it is working ? __eou__
it says the same as you ... =/ But I'm unable to find the keymap files . __eou__ inside **unknown** the file **unknown** . map doesn't exist . __eou__ In my case , the system was installed with brazilian keyboard layout . __eou__
Perhaps you should set up a dedicated partition for Lubuntu before the install using gparted livecd __eou__ No problem __eou__
i would go to the terminal and or recovery mode and run sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade __eou__
and how do you access the machine ? ssh or other remote protocol ? __eou__
so , would i just skip that part and move on to the next part or ? __eou__
kernel version doesn't matter as much , it 's Xorg differences that causes issues of discrepencies __eou__
Looks like mine is no longer supported . __eou__
I used the one I downloaded from AMD __eou__
right , if it 's older ATI card then you're probably out of luck as ati has afaik dropped support even for 4xxx radeons already __eou__ http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Quantal_Installation_Guide perhaps this helps ? __eou__
You need it in the mbr to boot . __eou__ here is a link to a chroot from a live cd to put grub in the mbr . https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_ChRoot __eou__ There is a boot repair app as well that can be run from the live cd with a recommended repair fix that will probably work as well , and if not will generate a bootscript we can look at if you post the URL . https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair __eou__ This herman link suggests it it 's for use by other programs or scripts . http://members.iinet.net/~herman546/p20/GRUB2%20Bash%20Commands.html#grub-mkdevicemap __eou__
quantal uses a newer version of the proprietary driver and support has been dropped for your card . All HD 2xxx - 4xxx series . __eou__
ubuntu-restricted __eou__
thank you . __eou__
Thanks . That 's what I'm looking for . __eou__
thanks __eou__
ah - gotcha - different problem than mine ;-) __eou__
He not as much as you lol . __eou__
i'll look for it , i must've missed it __eou__
ok __eou__ I installed amd 12.9 beta drivers and it broke the system again . no unity , no top bar , no title bar and close , minimize buttons __eou__ the amd 12.9 beta drivers didn't work with ubuntu 12.10 so I switched back to open source drivers __eou__ I will try 12.6 drivers in the morning , its almost 3 am here __eou__
not me , sadly . That 's what I'm getting help with __eou__
oops __eou__ that 's unfortunate - there are times when that *is* the solution :-/ __eou__
you didn't say anything to wilee-nilee , related ? involved ? __eou__
Your idea is good , but I like having the latest software on my laptop , and I don't want to install too much PPAs for it __eou__
ok thanks , i'll do that . __eou__
yeah the resolutions are still the same __eou__
do you know how to get to the software center __eou__
anyone , i'm having a bit of difficulty making a partition on there . i want part of the flash drive for ubuntu , the other for regular storage __eou__ i want to make a partition on there , and flipping the removable bit(making it look like hdd ) doesn't work __eou__ I WANT TO MAKE A PARTITION . I know what the instructions say , lol , I just need help making the partition .. __eou__

Thanks __eou__
yes , gmail is open in firefox .. when i click the launcher , it opens in firefox __eou__ miraj , i do get the " incoming message " popup on the top right desktop area which fades away after a few seconds ... but still a white enveloppe and no number on the launcher icon __eou__
I have no internet on the target machine __eou__ the answer is : use google . =/ __eou__ on another machine .. of course . =) Thank you anyhow . __eou__
I have nothing against early-adopting KDE , but Unity 's development cycle is a sinusoid with lots of stuff going down between stable releases . __eou__
or look on amazon etc , people usually add in reviews if it worked on ubuntu etc in reviews __eou__
My suspicion is pulse ... but that is always my suspicion ... of course it is usually right . __eou__
: my / partition is currently 93Gb ... maybe i should downsize a bit ? __eou__ : ubottu.com/factoids.cgi has been offline for a day or so now ... hey thanks though __eou__
I've already done that ( pretty sure ) by creating a DB user and giving it access __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
Sorry for getting mad then . I know sort of . I sent the command xrandr -- output default -- panning 1280x720 __eou__ I also made a new xrandr mode and added it __eou__ 1024x600 __eou__
ahh , okay , the package compiz-plugins was missing __eou__
very nice ! thanks ! __eou__
thank you :D If I copy my profile from a windows machine thunderbird , and paste it on my ubuntu machine , will that work or I will **unknown** the files ? __eou__
none in particular , want to learn , looking for a good online **unknown** __eou__
Yes . They did . They dropped support for the 2xxx-4xxx drivers . The legacy driver is the open source radeon driver you are using , and their older driver wont work with the newer xorg in quantal . __eou__
thanks bro i'll give it a try __eou__ but when i do nslookup then server 10.0 . 1.1 and type in a domin name that i spesfied it didnt work __eou__
sorry bro i never tryed making a hotspot =/ how about bluetooth ? or wired why dont u use that if u give me reasons i may find a way around =D __eou__ i am sre u tryed this http://www.howtogeek.com/116409/how-to-turn-your-ubuntu-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/ correct ? __eou__
2 problems i had with unetbootin : the ubuntu had a " install option all the time . Its not really a problem but is anoying when u just wanna use it . 2nd i did not manage to make it **unknown** ... __eou__ help would be **unknown** :D __eou__
yes , like I said , trying to guess files will nearly almost fail __eou__ open a web browser and in the address bar type the server name __eou__
thats what i did ... gives a very poor performance ... __eou__
can u disable ssid and ping it ? __eou__
and without command line ? __eou__ mean , through the GUI __eou__
Thats no Ubuntu ... __eou__
active as in a bootflag ? __eou__
gedit is actually listed under " installed " in synaptic ... can i remove complete ? __eou__
: compiz is a fun toy , however it can render a system in a rather broken state ... you might want to jot down a couple commands ... to attempt to reset unity & compiz try ( dconf reset -f /org/compiz/ ... setsid unity ) __eou__
: np ... it 's a bit of a kludge ... but works from your browser ... from the terminal something like perl offers alternatives __eou__
ah lol , laziness I guess , I am leaning over my desk and my linux boxes ' keyboard , using my laptop . I'll be sure to autocomplete next time , would be smart in a channel with 1573 users , eh ? ;) __eou__
all dwnloads i can get the link to , i have a metered internet but from 12 am to 5 am its free so i want to schedule my downloads for that time __eou__
4K pixels x 3K pixels __eou__
so i should ignore it ? __eou__
bekks is right , i just mount my sdb1/sdd1 to /media/sdb1 and /media/sdd1 respectively __eou__
I am using logged in remotely ( **unknown** , so the file is being opened locally . __eou__
thanx , ill try it __eou__
also keep in mind if you're running vnc , there 's some processor/gfx power going into doing the forwarding __eou__ def . worth a shot __eou__ sudo apt-get ! :) __eou__
I don't use wine , but I do have games like Oil Rush which barely run on my card even with Catalyst . __eou__
I thought it had been thanks . __eou__
I read that ATI had dropped support for the HD4000 series in their latest driver . Is ubuntu 12.10 using an older version ? __eou__
I liked those features , i could customize several options __eou__
AFAIK , there has always been an /etc/lsb-release file on Ubuntu . I can't recall about Debian ; it 's been too long __eou__
so delete it ? then how do I get the file back ? __eou__
#windows may know . you might just need to dd the iso to the flash . __eou__
how do i do that ? __eou__
ah thanks alot __eou__
the 12.10 installer was trying to update it . __eou__
that line indicates the GPU was reset at the driver level . It is often a normal event . Can you provide a pastebin of sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog ? __eou__
what are you trying to do ? __eou__
try logging back in __eou__ type exit again __eou__ then login as normal __eou__
I'm not fully sure how your doing your update , but on a normal system the debs end up in /var/cache/apt/archives/ __eou__
thank you will try , __eou__
" sudo nvidia-xconfig " then reboot may or may not solve your issue __eou__
I refer you to my second comment above __eou__
Again , sorry . you said " live cd ", which usually means an actual disc . If you are actually using a USB drive for it , you may have better luck with the disc . __eou__
wastrel yes it doesnt boot , hangs at " Stopping Save kernel messages [ Ok ] " __eou__ nopes , not a clean install __eou__ would want to upgrade __eou__ i've too much installed to do a clean install :P __eou__
best of luck - i hope it works out ! __eou__
gotcha __eou__
yes __eou__
i'll check into that .. thanks :) __eou__
he said his su is not working , which is a different matter __eou__
I think the issue is that root is disabled . If `su` isn't working at all then I think there are more serious issues . __eou__
np __eou__
Saturday . __eou__
i did no dice __eou__ if it would have worked i would stick with fedora __eou__ mint is like an off distro __eou__ and i use this thing for school __eou__
forked ? __eou__ they had an update on the 14th __eou__
probably , intel has excelent support __eou__
alot of these sound pretty indepth man alot of these people had to compile the kernel with card support ill read and see if i find anything worth its salt __eou__ i believe i found something im gonna post a link let me know if you tried the things posted in here on your computer __eou__
no need to be so mean . I am trying to install ubuntu 12.10 i need to know if cedar trail works with it . damn __eou__
It 's ubuntu basically . __eou__ Their modifications are reaaaally minor , it 's mostly the software suite which makes it so fast __eou__
I did and it gives me an error after I put the password in saying that im not allowed to do it [ usually on my Debian Desktop I Root Terminal to begin with or Su to do a Root Log-in for the same error ] __eou__
and bazhang : i'll try that in a while . i can't install coz i'm currently updating __eou__

i just went and got the gnome remix iso saved me the trouble of enabling the classic fall back __eou__
does the partition mount alright as ext4 ? __eou__
it is a good idea to know vi since it is pretty much available on every UNIX since the stone age __eou__
all it has is the two displays , when i click on one , the choices are either use this display or don't, the refresh rate , resolution , reflection , and rotation __eou__ there 's no mirror box to check/uncheck or anything besides that __eou__
after testing it on the Linux channel , foud that it didn't hold any info , yes it is external . After formatting adding the UUID to fstab __eou__ will partitioning the drive automatically format it ? __eou__
it was just settings disabled on compiz-settigs and work just fine , thanks dude ! __eou__
lol __eou__
why not just ppa-purge it __eou__ mint is not supported here . please dont ask for support with it here any longer __eou__
Last time I had that issue , my adapter was enabled when the indicator suggested it was disabled . A quick function key combo fixed me right u . __eou__
if you read , yes html5 is the slim lined players but anything that runs an add on the video will not work __eou__ couldnt her just run lshw -C Display __eou__
yeah , me neither . I think my comptuer just hates me . you think the folks in **unknown** would **unknown** helpful ? ( I'd hope so ... but ... ) __eou__

amd stopped radeon hd 4xxx support in fglrx __eou__
thanks , i will try that __eou__ though since i need to reboot to do that , any other ideas what might be the problem ? __eou__
installing it should have created a xorg . conf which specifies the driver __eou__
yes the file exist __eou__
tx for advice __eou__
Then go ahead with that then . __eou__
I used a script , which yes , eventually download the file directly from nvidia site __eou__
which graphics card do you have ? maybe the driver you installed is not compatible with your chipset __eou__
alright i removed bind9 but now i cant ping hostnames __eou__
no . what you did is a lot worse __eou__
what is name : name __eou__
I'm installing the proprietary driver , rebooting , then gonna check display properties brb __eou__ the display properties says 1920x1080 __eou__ but the screen is zoomed out with a black border around the screen . I wonder if scaling in is possible __eou__
k __eou__
just saw your " then you press enter so the command gets executed "... you forgot " and then you let go of the enter button " ;) __eou__
And when using x-swat , why dont you stick with that then ? __eou__
then use lsof or fuser to check what accesses it __eou__
i don't know ..... browser download size is 763MB something and torrent download size is 800MB __eou__
I changed back to the open source driver . I'm gonna install proprietary again then try the display control panel brb __eou__
xangua : thanks ! __eou__

what I don't get is why DBUS would care about dnsmasq __eou__
ops srry haven't kept up with ubuntu in a long while . Use Arch Linux primarily __eou__
There does appear to be integration by default , but I think it 's actually broken . opening a spreadsheet via nautilus results in Calc not having any global menu ( and thus no menu at all ) __eou__
i __eou__ i'd just consider it the most flexible/supported __eou__
maybe __eou__
ah , sorry , then I misunderstood your question __eou__
could you tell me what flags would I need to fix bad sectors ? __eou__
it 's the bootloader that would be important , not the directories it contains . a single usb stick can comtain many installers __eou__
I see that . __eou__
rebooted several times .. that same result .. __eou__
you said it works when one waits a bit . debugging for that __eou__
also http://paste2.org/p/2357940 __eou__
actually screw it , what command do you say to open up the network manager __eou__ openbox tweaking , need someone who is experienced __eou__
WI-FI Protected Setup BROKEN . Is it safe to continue using a router that has this feature even if it is disabled . __eou__

I see , but why under 800 mb then ? __eou__ why not add some media exaples , Big Buck Bunny movie or something ? __eou__
can you tell me those similar to imageRUNNER 2318 ? but i was trying imageRUNNER 2018 but it couldn't work ? __eou__
I could but the question is if I overwrote OS X would the partition boot ? __eou__

try pressing **unknown** , it 's the shortcut for resizing windows . It might work . __eou__ oh you don't any space left , yeah sorry . __eou__
thx __eou__
that would make since because the router i have at home is using wep atm and there is no issues at all but the work is wpa2 __eou__
how do you do that ? __eou__
- good thought forgot about that - I guess it held that name in ARP __eou__
thanks . I'll look it up =) __eou__

the pointer on using ip should be enough to help me troubleshoot ... I really appreciate it . Would like to PM you real quick ... that ok ? __eou__
if you did the name should be in the Download window in Firefox __eou__ if it 's dropping down to tty then your Display Manager isn't getting called on boot to run __eou__ try to run it manually __eou__
no idea . the one that came with Win8 __eou__
but what youre describing sounds like a full blown distribution solution , I just want to clone drive a to USB drive , partimage does the trick but only for one partition - not the entire drive . __eou__
you'll need to rerun your amd configuration then __eou__

what is that ? __eou__
I'm using " install Ubuntu alongside windows 8 " __eou__
like the unity search bar not working for ~ 4 weeks , that happened to me last upgrade __eou__
but why ? wouldn't it actually help to see what all these models have in common to get a better understanding of why this happens ? __eou__
it shows the " AMD " card __eou__
problem comes with UEFI enabled OS like windows 8 , grub might not work in that case __eou__
you did what i told ? __eou__ and you rebooted the system ? __eou__ i suppose it worked well in 12.04 ? __eou__ so i dont get it , what 's the problem ? __eou__
simply answer you can't without temporarily breaking your package system __eou__
can i downgrade to 12.04 __eou__
i have never tested grub with windows 8 , but in that case is preferable to have a boot partition . so yes you can try __eou__
Do you know the USB stick 's device path ? It should be something like /dev/sdb __eou__
wilee-nilee , Jimster480-L : in that case i should be fine . again it didn't boot . I'm going to try http://askubuntu.com/questions/178184/updating-to-windows-8-on-dual-boot-with-ubuntu from the live cd __eou__
yes i'm running 12.10 __eou__
they are in the software center ubuntu-restricted-extras or whatever desktop you are running . here is a link for other codes as well . http://www.ubuntugeek.com/install-mplayer-and-multimedia-codecs-libdvdcss2w32codecsw64codecs-on-ubuntu-12-10-quantal-quetzal.html __eou__ YOu don't have to instal the mplayer in the link but the codec info is helpful . __eou__
how do I add a new one ? __eou__
and have to activate it from the isp web site and i sign an agreement that they are not responsible for in case of intrusion into my system __eou__
I did and it worked :) __eou__
it works now ty __eou__
use firefox __eou__ it works there __eou__
hmm __eou__
use a CDRW instead of a CDR ? __eou__
this is a good thing , means it 's one less thing to worry about :) __eou__
that'is why people do clean install __eou__
Will have a look in a minute thanks . __eou__ It 's detecting the upgrade now , thanks . __eou__
really that easy ? __eou__
No i want to login remotely from my windows one or any computer to my ubuntu 12.10 __eou__ but I dont know how to do that __eou__

ok I see , so there is not a best practice to communicate between linux and windows __eou__ I was thinking on using open ldap to query and write to AD __eou__
: yes zykotick9 told me that ... Thank you ;) __eou__
good point thanks __eou__ **unknown** , thanks __eou__ lol __eou__ yes but would it be easier to learn c++ starting off or python __eou__
once you chroot the commands you run will act on the installed OS , not the live CD __eou__
there are those that have .. check youtube for people that have .. impressive . __eou__ you'll get a better idea with this link **unknown** __eou__
i found this command in french ubuntu documentation ! __eou__
so rename that to bluetooth . conf . disabled __eou__
yea but what service is called apache2 on ubuntu its the same OS .... I just helped my friend last week setup his Ubuntu VPS and itw as called httpd .... __eou__
so basically the system ( sudo ? the super user ? ) grants another user/group with permissions to manage objects files/directories but those objects files folders dont know anything about the user that is managing them , right ? __eou__
which address ? i tried to email the linux-kernel one __eou__
sudo apt-get -- purge remove hdjmod-dkms __eou__

Ahh , that explains why I couldn't figure out what it was . Ignore me then :) __eou__
i'll try that ! but for example i can't seem to uninstall packages while the upgade is running __eou__
they had to follow them for compatibility reasons __eou__ so they are 100% compatible __eou__
if you run : sudo iwlist scan eth3 do you see a lot of devices on the same channel ? __eou__ does the system have a switch or shortcut to enable / disable the wifi ? __eou__
I believe I had some , but I know that one of the early steps in the dist-upgrade process is to disable third-party sources ... __eou__ whattya think ? __eou__
well apt-get clean freed up plenty of space , so it worked on that end , but i should note that the upgrade was paused at a certain point __eou__ the upgrade had paused to ask me if i wanted to make changes to a certain file .. and while it still awaited my input I did apt-get clean .. hope that doesn't affect things __eou__
ok __eou__
/dev/mapper has 1 item control __eou__
are you a **unknown** user ? can you get my question solved ? __eou__
thanks I'll look into it ! __eou__
sweet , thanks __eou__
Then #vbox or ##apple would be better places to ask , as this particular problem has nothing to do with Ubuntu . __eou__
: I will check it . thanks __eou__
how , what ? __eou__
What 's the issue ? __eou__ You might have to add your user to the " disk " group and the log off/log on __eou__

it was long see 20:51 __eou__
Why not recommend it to anyone ? __eou__
people seem to really like that one , I for one , cant remember all the keyboard shortcuts __eou__
I got a lot of shutdown errors , and the boot sequence seemed off . Also , my CD drives were not working right . Lots of things were crashing too __eou__ where 12.04 was basically smooth sailing __eou__ also Unity seemed really sluggish on a fairly decent machine that runs perfectly under 12.04 __eou__
i am not a big fan of LTS __eou__
its fine , ya __eou__
oh hey , whats up parsnip , i came on here as Eyes Only a while ago , seems that flash player freezes my entire browser when i move my mouse or click inside the flash window __eou__
Have you tried Xubuntu or Lubuntu ? Barring hardware issues Lubuntu 12.04 should be considerably more " snappy " than Ubuntu 10.04 . __eou__
what I mean is : Holding on to 10.04 for as long as possible , and yes __eou__
run : sudo lshw -C disk ; sudo lshw -C drive to see the device names __eou__
I'm on my phone at the moment , otherwise I would . __eou__
I am new at ubuntu , should I just report at the ubuntu launchpad project ? __eou__
never mind ... it just dawned on me . Chrome doesn't support that site . It works fine in FF . __eou__
Thanks , that should keep me busy till I find something that works __eou__
i didnt ask anyone to support it . i simply asked if anyone runs the softwrae __eou__
yes but it won't be supported here as its an unofficial kernel __eou__
would love to use chrome . however , as I have read , only chromium and firefox support the webapp integration feature . __eou__
other times when I boot it shows ata 2.00 : revalidation failed ( **unknown** ) after a whole lot of lines of end_request : I/O error , dev sda , sector xxxxxx __eou__
I didn't format it , can't I get the data back ? __eou__
maybe try cinnamon ? http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/?page_id=61 __eou__ Cinnamon is Gnome 3 adapted to be more like Gnome 2 __eou__
My suggestion would be to upgrade your OS . __eou__ Did you see my messages ? __eou__
will try to purge the nvidia packages and see if it makes any difference installing them again after that :P __eou__
to be fair , I have never tried KDE . It does not look as visually appealing , but I have heard good things from smart trustworthy people __eou__ i should give it a shot __eou__
yeah i'm probably going to switch distros , but thanks ... before you go recommend a new distro ! __eou__
wish it works __eou__
this dkpg advice looks exactly like what I am looking for combined with the preserved /home on a separate drive . Do you have any adivce about PPDs ? They all get disabled on re-install __eou__
I use alot of KB shortcuts on my Win7 desktop , I really like them . But for some reason I never bothered to do it here in my linux on my laptop __eou__
I'm thinking of using 12.04 LTS with Cinnamon instead of Unity . It 's made by the makers of Linux Mint because they liked Gnome 2 __eou__ I was the one who mentioned cinnamon __eou__ I need some way to back up drives for VMs or just backing up , so if I want to upgrade Ubuntu , if I don't like it , I don't have to redo all of my settings . __eou__ I never got an answer on what I should use to get my windows drive onto a VM . Windows programs freeze up when I try to make the clone , clonezilla freezes when trying to restore , and I can't find any Linux apps to do the job , which would be the best if I could . __eou__
hay , should I go with btrfs ? : 3 __eou__
I just patch things that I need to . And build myself new kernels as time goes on . __eou__ I'll think about it . I was pretty sure it was on Unity though . __eou__
exact command to pastebin please , along with errors __eou__
Can't downgrade . __eou__
fantastic , please keep the chit chat in there and support in here :) __eou__
if you try to update what happens ? i wouldn't try anything in case of corruption though __eou__
you can check that in pavucontrol . __eou__ Does someone knows a tool to change the default icons in openbox ? I used lxappearence but that doesn't work : s __eou__

yup that 's what I am doing . :p __eou__
other than screaming , shedding a few tears and closing my eyes and counting to ten - I haven't touched it since I changed it . I'm relatively new to ubuntu - I tend to stick with it for my media centre and a few other things - do you have any useful **unknown** ? __eou__
they are just temp mounts that get mounted in /media/ , df output not enough ? __eou__
what do you mean ? normal connection , I think __eou__ i was reading and following an tutorial , and I successfully done it all , except for this part that I cant solve no matter what , i've googled it but no luck at all __eou__
so whear is the problem ? __eou__
what happen if i activate this one ? __eou__
What 's the point of sharing a wi-fi connection over wi-fi anyway ? __eou__ Can't you just connect to the primary network ? __eou__
didn't you need to put in a file for the AACS dynamic library , too ? __eou__
I never thought that a wifi device could operate in two modes at the same time __eou__
hope that does it __eou__
there it is . under hciconfig as well and is connected already , as i can check with hcitool con . the connection was established with bluez 's tools __eou__ in my understanding the bluetooth stack setup is complete . __eou__
k . So you do have a medium that 's big enough to hold the old one . So as I've said , I would use " dd " to backup the corrupt drive to not risk any further data modification __eou__ yeah , replace /dev/sdc with the correct drive . And of course , of= shall hold the correct output location . Maybe ~/backup . dd or so __eou__
you can always disable the onboard :) __eou__ but let me see if i can't find how to specify one sec __eou__ i assume your monitor is plugged into the discrete card ? __eou__
thanks for the reply . The system works fine ( I have used it for many years) . It is only within the last week that it is requesting root password . When I use my own the password box wobbles and tells me I have it wrong . I don't have root password and it has never been set up . I can perform the tasks through Terminal but was concerned why this has changed recently . __eou__
oh , ok , I was just thinking about getting you to some better support .. I didn't know there was only one person there __eou__
well , if bumblebee doesn't work , I'm out of ideas __eou__

so what can I do then to fix this ? __eou__
I'm on precise right now I used to love unity and had a great cube setup with a script to load it that stopped working as of precise I gave up on that desktop and switched to the shell . __eou__ Worked fine basically as well , but the desktop lost some inherent focus when you messed with compiz enough at least for me . __eou__
I do have access to iLO __eou__

what is that nice tweaks program that lets you customize your desktop / gui ? __eou__
isnt the same since ubuntu changed the settings interface . From where should I tell it the ipaddress . I have it locally setup on one computer and on a wireless network on another . The local device see the printer but will not set it as default . Both find the printer on the network __eou__ isnt the same since ubuntu changed the settings interface . From where should I tell it the ipaddress . I have it locally setup on one computer and on a wireless network on another . The local device see the printer but will not set it as default . Both find the printer on the network __eou__
yes __eou__
" panel ". And there is no way I am aware of moving it . __eou__ create a . desktop file for it ( I never needed to do so ) __eou__ Most likely , they are lost . __eou__
so i guess its /etc/ssh/sshd __eou__
I dont want them to see folders above * __eou__
it has like DHCP server and LAMP i think __eou__
what did you try so far ? __eou__ **unknown** __eou__ did you try my link __eou__
its definitely booting in uefi mode , so you mean I should get an option in the bottom part of the partition section asking where to put bootloader ? __eou__

maybe ... when i run a Partition manager tool __eou__
that command does more that that . it removes everything lol __eou__
yea i agree , but i am familiar with it __eou__ are there alternatives that the ubuntu community recommends ? __eou__ is Landscape kinda like webmin ? __eou__
I still have the WIndows OS partition come up ( it boots ) but the Windows data drive - which has my profile does not show up __eou__ yes , I have a slightly outdated back-up - so I still lose some data .. __eou__
yes :) __eou__ probably a differnet default app set __eou__

I'm back , I have the same problem with all my CD 's plus my USB __eou__ I think the most easiest way to fix this is to install the 12.04 version of Ubuntu ? even if I don't want , I want to struggle a little bit with this __eou__
http://ubuntu-cpu-thermometer.fyxm.net/ __eou__ i want shutdown the pc for temperature at 75 C __eou__ for more safe for my pc __eou__
I had a similar problem once with 12.04 . I never figured out why it happened . I tried again and it worked . Sorry I can't be of more help . __eou__
Thanks for the suggestion wilee-nilee __eou__
hmm there aren't any processes that are really taking up that much cpu . Maybe I need to have my host give more cpu to the VM __eou__
that made no sence to me what so ever . __eou__
i might have , but I don't remember doing so __eou__
it doesn't matter if it resets the grub conf file __eou__
ok is there an expert in ubuntu here now ? __eou__
watchdog ? __eou__ watchdog is just what the manpage says => it 's kind of a " dead man switch ", cheap version . ( Basically , as long the user space watch dog process runs often enough to service the /dev/watchdog device , the kernel considers everything okay , as in " even if it 's bad , it will fix itself ", while if the watchdog user space process dies , it considers the system fucked up enough that will hard reset the box . __eou__
doing what you are suggesting is not something I'd recommend __eou__ downloading an image will determain what virtual software you have to use __eou__ not all images work with all vm software __eou__
:) yeah though the plugin was already not checked . i get these annoying messages in the channel about ' entered room ' and ' left room ' __eou__
you can open the config file in gedit if you want __eou__ never used it , sorry __eou__
First builtin monitor " quit ", but was visible in display settings ( ubuntu 12.04 ) ; that is , two monitors show , the builtin and the vga __eou__
that 's not going to happen __eou__
ok good , I wonder why nothing would boot earlier and now magically windows booted ? __eou__ I wonder what the initial problem was ? __eou__
check the file permissions to make sure its not read only for root __eou__
1:00 . 0 VGA compatible controller [ **unknown** : Advanced Micro Devices [ AMD ] nee ATI RV635 [ Mobility Radeon HD 3650 ] [ **unknown** ] __eou__
You can open it with gedit . __eou__ There is a PPA install app . __eou__ remastersys __eou__ I would clone it rather then make a ISO , as suggested with clonezilla . __eou__
the first thing you need to do is boot to a live cd . __eou__
before you can do that , you'l need to add that drive to /etc/fstab . Otherwise you'll run into problems when you reboot . And you'll probably want to mount it somewhere other than /media ( probably /mnt) . __eou__
pastebin " cat /etc/apt/sources . list " __eou__
yes I do __eou__

yes it checks everything fine , it just says I'm up to date . But I've never had that happen for days right after a new release . __eou__
dougbb is getting the text along with the graphics ( the boot and shutdown text) , and just wants the graphics only ( the ubuntu logo with the dots) . __eou__
why use force ? __eou__
I think that 's what originally happened . So , when it unmounted , it removed the directory . __eou__ they do . I'm just giving him a start . After that , I'm not sure what he'll need to do . __eou__
flamed for what ? Trying to contribute ? The stupid webpage is like 100 pages long of pure text and it doesnt explain how to email the list or anything . __eou__
really ! I'll ook into that , thanks :) __eou__ sweet , I got **unknown** in glxgears . I guess it installed right ? __eou__ anyway thanks for that knowledge bump :D __eou__
how did you configure your network initially then __eou__
lol __eou__

**unknown** __eou__ this machine is far from up , and keeps dropping the download __eou__
maybe you chose the wrong drive __eou__
ah , I think your right . __eou__
nope , it 's the file that flashplugin-installer is trying to download during config __eou__
I see ... ok , thanks ! Kind of interesting though , I'd say that the partitions are there anyway , there is no difference between 32- and 64-bit partitions , just the files ( ... most of them , I'm pretty sure ) on them need to be replaced ... __eou__
Oh ... ok Thanks a lot ! __eou__
well , im learning __eou__
it 's in **unknown** 3.0 **unknown** **unknown** __eou__
Because that 's how life is . __eou__
Otherwise you'll have to do a separate step to recover the bootloader . __eou__
I mean I know why it 's saying it , I want it to stop saying it ... __eou__
OerHeks thanks those are useful __eou__ can scale do windows aero style snap ? __eou__
I don't think dd has a GUI , I don't feel like doing it in terminal . __eou__
doubt it , i think its the live cd screensaver __eou__
Don't you need root privileges to install any packages ? Or at least in Ubuntu by default __eou__
if not unity , then what ? __eou__
! **unknown** : __eou__ possible ? sure . Still , if you check the ubuntu/linux virus attack logs , it 's q __eou__ QUITE rare . windows is a bigger target and OSX is catching up . __eou__ but check with the penetration testing experts , not me ... __eou__
Once I install Windows , I will install Ubuntu .. I guess many here would have faced the same issue __eou__ / ActionParsnip - I will recover my Windows Image , shrink the remaining partition and then do a fresh Ubuntu install __eou__ wondering if windows image restore may delete Ubuntu .. __eou__
win7 can shrink it 's own partitions too __eou__
that 's no good . I think it 's your kernel if you aren't getting any output __eou__
you should be able to intercept the stdout stream and it all be ascii . Also remember there is stderr **unknown** as well :) __eou__

yes i do __eou__ minimal ubuntu doesnt come with a desktop . Thats for server installs . But imho its kinda bloated for a server __eou__
Thanks ! I just have not done dual boot from separate drives before . He should have no problem then __eou__
Not sure really __eou__ I tried using 12.10 but the ati driver is a no go and screw my system with a massive lag overall , so reverted back to 12.04 which is smooth as butter . __eou__ do you think you can help ? :-( __eou__
thanks __eou__
pastebin ? __eou__ there are scripts that output to pastebin all your output pastebinit for example __eou__
did you google it ? If you can show me some threads i will look into it . __eou__
Welcome __eou__
i am on ubuntu 12.04 with a wired internet connection . I need to share this connection via wifi to a windows 7 system . Any suggestion please ? __eou__ that was for 2 Ethernet ports __eou__
I don't trust upgrades and I find them quite of a trouble . I never did a upgrade . __eou__
thanks , but i use find . grep " **unknown** " / and nothing happen : __eou__
nothing about php in there __eou__
, have you ever flashed a bios to add something to it ? __eou__
can you help me ?? __eou__
LibreOffice and OpenOffice is basically the same thing ... just a few more ( wanted ) features in Libre compared to Open :) __eou__
I'm not using unity . While running that I would get a crash every +/- 23 minutes __eou__ How do you mean too old ? I can run any game at 100+ fps without problem and on ubuntu 10.10 I have had 0 gfx issues for 3 years __eou__
ok __eou__
, have you ever flashed a bios to add something to it ? __eou__
the load displayed by uptime is 25 and i do not know the reason for it . i'd like to find out what causes this load . __eou__ any ideas where to look __eou__
Sorry I didn't get that . What do you mean ? __eou__
yep , I know . didn't know tho that one existed ;) __eou__
try sudo shutdown -h now ( h = halt ) __eou__
then I'd suggest borking throuhg your BIOS-settings :) __eou__
I looked at PDFLib but you have to use " make " to install , which surely needs root privileges __eou__
could be some card that confuses jocky . you could check the forums and askubuntu.com about that exact card/chipset __eou__
its not included i even tried upgrade virtualbox .. maybe let me try to reinstall __eou__ i re installed it , still that module is not there and command not found __eou__
each time i connect using sakis 3g , it asks some parameters __eou__ is it possible to make sakis 3g script noninteractive __eou__
10.04 is lts , i told you they get released every 2 years __eou__
I don't want to do a fresh install , I have set up how I like it too many times . I just want my computer to function how I like it for a while :P __eou__ why do you think I'm still using Natty ? __eou__
will do , thanks __eou__
i use it ... i've not heard of any vulnerabilities . __eou__
yeah , I get it __eou__
re-read what ubottu told you , there are release notes there __eou__
auronandace : thank you __eou__
yes , again but id say most the internet relies on flash still __eou__
no idea as I don __eou__
how ? __eou__
but it didn't? That 's odd . __eou__
i have nvidia __eou__
I see it is the classic gnome theme __eou__ ah I see . Thanks . __eou__ are you using classic gnome session too ? __eou__
i already booted from usb & installed , but when i remove the usb key and reboot , i don't see a boot manager __eou__
well my goal is to eventually do a gpu passthrough for xen so that i can boot another OS on the pci-e card , while keeping ubuntu as the main os on my igpu __eou__
its in the repos ...... __eou__ install the sshfs package __eou__
me too , but apparently in GNOME 3 they are there , but the panel menu now comes up with Alt+right click , not just right click __eou__
Ubuntu won't have had anything to do with it most likely , it will have been packaged by Debian developers ... So perhaps the maintainer of octave has gone awol __eou__
could be upwards of several hundred (~500 ) __eou__
If you need to run something , for example , 356 time a year , you need a better task management system . Something like **unknown** would do it but you'll need to do some programming to get where you want . __eou__
technically it can , but that 's not the issue . it 's a kernel limitation . the kernel only lets you have 254 interface aliases __eou__
I was considering just doing a fresh install . __eou__
what is it you want to do or know ? __eou__
it 's not updated to 12.10 though . So you're mileage may vary . __eou__
here is a comparison . normal sudo user , which works , on the right , new user on the left http://www.blindmanstudio.com/dropbox/2012-10-22_0513.png __eou__
I have it in my home directory . __eou__

yes plenty __eou__
A firewall doesn't need a GUI though . The sort of use who needs a GUI probably wouldn't understand the rules in a firewall anyway __eou__
ok . __eou__
ah .... never used it . I've only used TASM , MASM , 6502/6510 assemblers __eou__ btw ... if you're targeting Linux , you can use gas and gdb ; if you're using Windows , you can use MASM and Developer Studio __eou__ all of which are free __eou__ ah ... thought you were just wanting to use that one because it was free __eou__
sorry...I'm talking about bugs.launchpad.net , specifically __eou__

why not create one yourself ? __eou__
That 's pretty cool , **unknown** __eou__ Oh maybe pavucontrol is what I used , iunno . I just search in the K **unknown** __eou__ Yes . An ad built-into your operating system .. " **unknown** " is the only thing that comes to mind :P __eou__

okey .. :) __eou__
it 's brand new hardware , and connected to the motherboard via a SATA cable . __eou__
thanks , im gonna have another look at this and let you know if i get stuck __eou__ ;) thanks for the assurance it will work __eou__
than that should be enough to explain my problem __eou__
So how o you expect your Windows pc to know the IP of the name of your Ubuntu box ? __eou__ Did you check the DNS settings and host entries on your router ? __eou__
hahahahha ok ok __eou__ I'm adding the repository and trying to install postgres , but apt-get complains that the package is unathenticated __eou__
especially if you removed/changed disks , it might have altered the expected behaviour __eou__
thanks __eou__
it appears that way except i've disconnected all of my hard drives __eou__
I tried , but I get this : Mount failed : Error mounting : mount exited with exit code 1 : helper failed with : __eou__
You're welcome __eou__
not that i know of __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
exfat __eou__
i dont even know if the intel audio is still a known issue . you could try a live cd . see if it makes the noise . that way the hd is not in use . ;) __eou__ get a ssd ;) best investment i ever did . __eou__
sounds fun . How do you know where the bad spot is ? __eou__
It 's squashfs image I'm working on based off the a legit ISO __eou__
you may need drivers for your onboard graphics . im using an ati card so can't compare . I suspect that is likely your issue . __eou__
it sure as hell isn't a valid filesystem that I can see __eou__ just dd the iso to a stick , and it'll be fine __eou__
well we don't have 304.60 in the repo yet , we have 304.51 , 304.43 and 304.48 , ( 304.60 is in the x-updates ppa though ) __eou__
I probably cannot help with being stuck on VESA . What I can tell you is that the radeon driver likely will work but not well , that many crucial compositing operations will still not be hardware accelerated , and compiz and/or unity will crash often . I recommend sticking with 12.04 until the ATI situation improves a lot . __eou__ So , no one here knows about altering the background colors for program icons in the Unity Launcher ? Not the launcher overall background color , but the background per icon . __eou__
( assuming you're competent enough to use it , aas it 's 100% text based ) __eou__ why eventually ? if the live cd doesn't work for some reason , thats what the alt . cd is for . __eou__
now just do something with apt-get so it can configure your latest kernel ( or try dpkg -- configure -a ) __eou__ what did you purge by the way ? __eou__
tried 10.04 on your new HDD , then upgrade ? __eou__
yep , I dd if =/ dev/zero of =/ dev/sda bs=512 count=1000 after to make sure it wasn't something goofy there , and when that still failed I manually created a single primary partition __eou__
so are running nouveau __eou__
so you have two versions listed in chrome :/ /plugins ? __eou__
seems to have two define __eou__
from what I gather you are correct __eou__
nyRednek dr_willis how can I check if it is indeed using a swap right now __eou__
that and nvidia are the only things I can think of that are unusual __eou__
the place has nothing to do with it __eou__ verify what ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I don't understand what your actual problem is , it 's doing what it 's meant to do __eou__ that will be gnome-keyring __eou__
must . have . native . ubuntu . __eou__
can I see the output of apt-cache policy fglrx-updates | grep -i installed __eou__
ok will do , i never realised they packaged their own versions __eou__
I've some problem with my nvidia and I've a couple of questions about how can I change and make effective some options in the module __eou__ If I can't solve my cpu issue setting module options I would like to probe or remove the module __eou__ basing the choice from user or kernel I'm booting __eou__ sorry but I'm also a irc noob so I don't know much the etiquette here __eou__
thanks , it 's the biggest jump in ui weirdness ive seen from ubuntu in a long time .. __eou__
You are welcome , mate . :-) __eou__
what 's the exact error __eou__
he just wants a large physical volume . __eou__ its hard not to notice that your two hard drives suddenly became one __eou__
Simultaneousness r/w 's even with fake raid will prove to have a dramatic increase in responsiveness with application load times vs large file to mem queries . __eou__ and in terms of TRIM support , so long as he selects a fs that supports it , he'll have no issues . __eou__
don't use " sudo su " ever __eou__ ubuntu does come with vim-tiny by default __eou__ re_ jordanm 's aptitude suggesion . DON'T use that method if you are using 64bit ! __eou__
LVM is configurable during the installation . It'll be a much simpler solution __eou__
hmm __eou__
The main reason I wanted to do it was because of the hard drives being rather small individually . Not only that but when I turned off RAID in the BIOS and set it to AHCI , they still came up in a RAID sort of way __eou__
TRIM Support was added the the kernel in 08 , 4 years for LVM support is plenty of time . __eou__ So long as the LV is formatted with a suitable FS it'll work __eou__
17:46 : 16 < jordanm > **unknown** : " automatic " installations occur when something is installed because it depends or recommended by a package that it was told to install ( which is manual ) __eou__ if I say apt-get install foo and it installs bar also because bar is a depends " foo " is a manual installation and " bar " is an automatic __eou__
yes __eou__ in fact , I tried it multiple times , with 12.8 and 12.9 Beta __eou__
i have no idea __eou__
may i PM you ? __eou__
" lspci | grep -i vga " __eou__
nvidia-current would be fine . __eou__
i have it in a lan __eou__ with a DNS server __eou__
k , I try this one too , thx __eou__
thanks , in the moment i keep it as it is , till i consider another distribution __eou__
haha , I had imagine something xD Thanks a lot bro ! __eou__
You'll have to stop it then . It 's broken anyhow . What you might be able to do ( and somene else will probably be able to answer this better than I can ) is download the iso and burn it to a DVD . Then use that to install . It *should* detect the current system , and allow you to upgrade it . __eou__
just remember to re-install it if you do an upgrade , just to keep things tidy __eou__
ugh ... too late , I'm just sticking with LTS for now __eou__ no compiz crashes since your fix ? __eou__
Yes . :) __eou__
the official is in ' **unknown** **unknown** ' __eou__ you are asking us to help you to get your system unstable ... that 's not the purpose of this channel __eou__
the answers you give were literally sidestepping the question . thats not how we make progress __eou__
:) __eou__
then igonore me ! sorry , i " guessed " wrong ;) __eou__
yeah its all red in the pie chart __eou__
my cursor won't change in newly started apps either . i had this problem in 12.04 too , but i just ignored it ( was hoping it would be fixed in 12.10 ) __eou__
not launch terminal , but set the default terminal application __eou__ it used to be in the settings->details->default applications equivalent settings tab __eou__
nice , thanks :) __eou__
i dont know what PTP is __eou__
there is a great deal of trust we give to canonical and i just want to quantify that with a real number __eou__
What is the output of " lsb_release -d "? __eou__
i am wireless __eou__
yeah that is probably it , just delete that file and try to log in again __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
ok , I've never played with grub , how do I go about that ? __eou__
should be dozens of ways to convert mp3 to wav . ive never really needed to . __eou__ you see this ? http://ardour.org/mp3 __eou__
yes it is . __eou__
still confused to why I had to do it diff this time thanks alot __eou__
for your variable : startnotify=`echo -e " foo1 \n foo2 " ` i think __eou__ doesn't work , sorry x ) __eou__

to answer your question I have root access .. it is my desktop computer in a remote site ... I am able to ssh into the machine , and I am able to VNC I am just not able to see the panels on my remote desktop ... only the background the icons and folders on the background , and the terminal window ..

ok , thanks for the link __eou__
i do it on my terminal doin updates sudo apt-get update __eou__
Thanks . But Canonical NEEDS to make this **unknown** . __eou__
how did you add nomodeset without getting to grub ? __eou__
relog didn't work __eou__ should i restart __eou__
anyways , if you were using ubuntu 12.10 wich is supposed to work with it , after a few months when a new version of iOS is released , the support will break ... is a never ending story __eou__
Ah . __eou__
ok __eou__ any change this totally blow up in my face when i relog ? i've become scared to restart because of bad experiences __eou__
this is not a discussion channel so if you have a specific question you need help with then please ask on one line so as not to congest the channel __eou__
didn't help __eou__ same error __eou__
I actually am looking to give the Ubuntu base an overhaul ( kinda proof-of-concept and also so I know I can do this ) __eou__ and I'm not too fond of some of the changes Mint has made to Ubuntu __eou__
ok . i'm sorry but i have no more ideas for now __eou__
I'm going to see if I can recreate . Meanwhile , maybe someone here knows something off the top of their head . __eou__ IDE = PATA __eou__ Same difference . __eou__

what 's the difference between point 5 and 6there __eou__
Yeah , it 's actually my home directory , it get shared nfs regardless of what machine I'm logged into __eou__ I'm only seeing the behavior when I ssh into the machien the disk is local to . __eou__ specifically the /home partition is automounted to **unknown** __eou__ after I log in most things work , although some scripts fail as does trn __eou__ oh also this just started a few days ago , I'm not sure when , but less than a week ago . presumably it 's caused by some package that was updated . __eou__ the configuration files fstab , nfs , auto . home , have not been modified since Jun ' 11 __eou__ **unknown** you probably want to investigate the ' find ' command __eou__
thats what i want to do ... how would i do that ? __eou__
There are two commands that is gthe save the other is the insert , honestly I have never used either , and I have W7 and 3 linux installs on a single HD , that is rather old school . __eou__

I was going to suggest you g over to their site lots of info there all Ive ever done is grab a rstp stream and save it locally using Dumprtsp __eou__
k , from where ? __eou__
it works good and you can switch between them with the alternatives system __eou__
it didnt , i copied the sample from my /usr , relogged , and now its gone again apparently __eou__
no , I am trying to help alagu __eou__

where did you get this xz ? __eou__
The admin account is the one made on install , and any others made to be admin accounts . __eou__
have you used the script they mention ? __eou__
You give a specific addition to your sources . list , that is the web page look closer at the instructions . __eou__
i think unity is _worse_ on netbooks as it wastes so much screen estate , but great on desktops ;) __eou__ uname -a __eou__
But maybe I'm wrong . Already forgot how I did this in the past . __eou__
for starters you might wanna start with https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/drbd.html for distributed filesystem __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ubuntucloud.html also for openstack stuff __eou__ in general , just look at server documentation - it 's pretty straightforward __eou__
ubuntu gets synced from debian on each release __eou__
THANKYOU . one more thing though . how now do i cd into the directory of that file ? __eou__ like , if i wanted to do " which bash " & automatically go to that directory __eou__
yes sorry for bothering you __eou__ :( __eou__
do you know gearman ? __eou__
thanks for that last one __eou__ have you heard of anyone doing this before ? __eou__
I did that , still says the same __eou__

thanks , how do I change that loading screen to another picture for example __eou__
bingo ! thanks .. __eou__
I thought you can't open the terminal ? :P __eou__
plug directly into the modem and see if you can connect to webpages etc __eou__

Have you verified the browser 's using a font that does have those ? __eou__
what __eou__ I don't have any idea what you're saying __eou__

there is literally no reason to use a 32bit OS on a 64bit Arch . __eou__
the artefacts were noticed with different versions of fglrx . The problem occurs only in fullscreen espically with opengl apps . __eou__
Why ? __eou__ Yes __eou__
and 10.04 and 10.10 are no longer supported __eou__
so any ideas about a fix ? __eou__
yes it 's probably hardware specific since the two installations should be completely separate from each other . does that mean that I should post a bug towards the motherboard manufacturer ? __eou__
at the start . or set the grub menu to not hide . __eou__
maybe you can help **unknown** . DL'd a package and attempted to dpkg but the darn thing keeps trying to DL again . __eou__
what package are you trying to get information about ? __eou__
tried that also , it says I have broken packages and dependencies aren't met __eou__ i will pastebin output __eou__
paste the exact command that you're typing in here . __eou__

you havent heard what i said , dkms packages need kernel headers , else they dont build , or you dont know what dkms packages are __eou__ in what channel ubuntu packages use to hang ? __eou__
I build it from svn . Can't find good docs to dig more into it . Problem is - webcam not shown at all ... All video **unknown** I saw - after first start , program have webcam source already present ... No idea what to do ... Their IRC channel is empty __eou__
not a problem . Glad you got it worked out . __eou__
thanks . but Do you know any tool like apache - **unknown** ? ab is merely an example . __eou__
Nah , it will never happen I bet . They [ Canonical ] will just keep working on Unity . __eou__ They [ Canonical ] believe Unity is meant to improve user experience from GNOME-Shell ; personally I think KDE would be the best heehee :P __eou__
i think so . i've some things to learn about dpkg __eou__ when we try to install rhythmbox , we're told the package is obsolete .. __eou__ said what i meant much better , **unknown** __eou__ when did unity show up ? __eou__

I'm not sure about that , but I did try the driver that nvidia website offers for linux and it gave me blank screen . installing the driver like you said is safe ? I mean what if I get black screen ? __eou__ well I can but last time I did it , it removed the entier xserver xD hehe I'm installing it right now . let see what happens __eou__ okay the driver is installed , but when I run the cpanel it says " You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X driver .

What a magical repair click . ;) __eou__
if you don't see any difference , why not just use sudo __eou__
maybe ... xrandr -s 0 helps __eou__
No problem hope that helps . __eou__
just reboot your pc __eou__
I was just wondering if that was normal . But from the sound of you asking me that , it sounds like it is . __eou__
this might help .... > http://askubuntu.com/questions/184269/how-can-i-get-sli-working-with-295-40 __eou__

My internet cut off __eou__ Hi folks , I want to download images off a website I tried wget -r -A jpeg , jpg , bmp , gif , png http://www.domain.com but I'm just getting . html files __eou__
they removed that on 12.10 __eou__
You need back story ? __eou__
it usually should go blue when a new email arrives but it does not and it doesn't show the history like in 12.04 ; __eou__
of course __eou__
it appears the other way around on my system , 12.10 , is there any reason this may be the case ? __eou__ and is it alright to just change /proc/mounts , to get them mounted where i need them ? __eou__ they are set up the way i want them in fstab , and the client hasnt changed , i set up a new server , the only thing in fstab that has been changed is hostname of the new server __eou__
i don't think so , skype is set to use pulseaudio local server in audio devices __eou__ ' Record from input : Master ' __eou__ I only see PulseAudio as an option . __eou__
need nothing but my win7 partitions __eou__ i have a dual boot setup , if that makes a difference __eou__
the dialog is modal , you cannot alt-tab it , it stick on top with focus __eou__
Is there an Ubuntu 12.10 image for Macs ? The standard desktop image does not boot on this Mac . __eou__
nope , of course , a couple of devs will continue the development i think __eou__
I agree . This is partly a matter of pride . I can get Linux to run on a lot of stuff . It annoys me that this solution eludes me . __eou__
Thanx , bye __eou__
How did you delete the partition table ? __eou__
is phonon stiull installed on ubuntu by default ? __eou__

I was trying to delete a thing called **unknown** __eou__
Does ubuntu do it by /etc/skel ? __eou__
just firefox , terminals , thunderbird . __eou__ Oh , forgot to mention . I used pithos before the problem happened . __eou__ My guess pithos caused the problem . __eou__

ubuntu 12.10 , upstart replaces ini **unknown** __eou__ lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 21 May 23 18:11 /etc/init . **unknown** -> /lib/init/upstart-job __eou__
Is like when you go to **unknown** , you are redirect to a sign in page . Same thing in my school . I have to enter a username and password , but i never make it to that page , it keep loading and loading __eou__ it happens with firefox and chronium __eou__
my bad , now i see 1 missing block :( __eou__
i don't think i ran out of space , it is a 16gig sd card with nothing on it __eou__
may concept is that when people are connected to wifi , it will get connected but when they open their browser it will redirect to a website which requires username and password before they can browse internet __eou__
good point . __eou__
yeah most indicators don't work like that , indicator-sound loads when the panel starts __eou__
Personally I don't allow windows to make a boot partition . So I just make a single ntfs with a boot flag with gparted then use the manual instal with the windows disc , sda1 is a boot partition and has the boot flag as of now and sda2 is the OS . __eou__
I have 1.5 g unallocated space in my exteded martition but I can't resize it to move the unallocated space out to the main hard drive so I can use it to resize windows __eou__
thx too __eou__
sorry , didn't get your question .. __eou__
then tell your uncle to install ssh , so you can log on to his PC and do it for him ( imho ) __eou__
I know I am telling them how to get that unallocated next to windows in order to do this the ubuntu has to be moved against the swap then the extended up against the left end of the ubuntu . __eou__
updates tab bottom drop down set it to for any new version __eou__ cool __eou__
nah ... this is a server . no gui please =P __eou__
im trying to find it __eou__
yes they work . __eou__

is it on any of them ? __eou__
thanlks for warning __eou__ ATI Radeon Mobility X1400 __eou__ it 's in my laptop i use for everything , watch movies connected to my tv . __eou__ friend , i have an older desktop with ubuntu too . what thing didn't work in your desktop ? __eou__ now i am getting scared ... but i'll update anyway both machines XD __eou__
Yeah both have home directories __eou__
why isn't automatic ? __eou__
I'm not in 12.10 right now but I would just access it from the software center __eou__ I know nothing about this area , just a heads up . __eou__ If your OS is runnimg fine I would ignore the start and stop code . __eou__
I would have tried that , but I know nothing of any scripting for ubuntu , how/where would I go to find out ? ( since I assume such documentation would be lengthy ) __eou__
depends on the plan i think , personally I use hostgator and the business plan is quite good and allow you to host as many sites as you want ( unlimited ) __eou__ http://dreamhost.com/servers/compare-our-products/ __eou__

I'll read further but the first sentence says Software RAID __eou__
yes it is in universe in 12.10 __eou__
are you saying to do this from Busybox ? __eou__ that will fix broken packages . That 's not my case . Thanks . DaemonicApathy , we have a RAID controller on the MB . The system runs but the guy that installed it must have done something strange , because it throws errors constantly when running anything via the cli . I managed to fix some of the errors by chmoding the directories that it mentions but I was hoping to use the installer to either replace the core system files ( like a Windows XP repair i __eou__
ad what does #ubuntu or lubuntu have to do with fluxbox ? __eou__
Any time . GIMF :-) __eou__
wouldn't you have to be in the same network ? __eou__
sadly , Ubuntu is still one of the best . __eou__

Ubuntu has different OS in the works I believe I was just looking around I see nothing yet . __eou__
Ive had the same problem before ( and thats how I fixed it and I dont think its a driver issue as I was using ubuntu drivers __eou__
is it a tar . gz ? __eou__
Sure , I can do that . Btw , I should also mention that I am using Cinnamon __eou__
full sentence ? __eou__
well , there were some changes recently that affect the way graphics are rendered .. Not sure what version that happened on .. But I know 6.7 . 5-7 was the previous version I had installed where everything was " right " __eou__
what is unity ? __eou__ I have whatever 12.04 has . __eou__
yep __eou__
ha , ok . didn't know about that . __eou__
Honestly , it 's a better idea to simply reinstall the apps after a clean installs . Distribution upgrades are ... well , hectic , in my personal opinion . __eou__
right ;) __eou__
: i want **unknown** to be the owner .. what would the syntax b ? __eou__
Sadly it has not resolved anything ) : __eou__
i think you are overly worried ( like the risk is non-existent) , but if you are concerned , by all means change them to have https:// instead of http __eou__
yup . vmware tools installed successfully , thanksalot __eou__
i used the alternate install CD of 12.04 so this might be alright for server , right ? __eou__
yeah , I guessed that much , I guess I was just wondering why it drops off that badly , considering that the example is fairly simple , i.e. why does this get so bad while running SCII in Wine will still get 60 ish fps on my system __eou__ thanks for taking a quick stab at the Cairo stuff , I know it gets complicated and you were trying to help others at the same time , sleep well __eou__
the packages distributed are signed . __eou__ man apt-key __eou__
the libtiff5-dev package you mean ? __eou__
Should have sound stock __eou__
Someone asked what Unity was , I used Ubottu to answer . __eou__
aww thanx but who are you __eou__ : you see no love from unity to us ... we are nothing , nothing at all __eou__
Please do not use that language . __eou__
then probably dont need it __eou__
i'll reboot __eou__ it WORKED !! __eou__
so , is it recording from a webcam ? then the webcam might not just record 30fps __eou__
yeah , permissions just don't exit on NTFS , I certainly won't dispute that __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
I can't boot from ubuntu live usb .... it 's not booting it gives me grub rescue , **unknown** how can I chk my ram and hdd ? Jordan_u : yes I'm sure I set up bios to boot from usb __eou__
: manufacture - micromax , model - MMX352G __eou__
take a look at your device . is there anything written on it ? The name of the manufacurer , a model number ? __eou__
No , you can't really break a BIOS by doing anything in software . __eou__
but this will install the dependencies of current version , and the lastest version dependencies might be different __eou__
k thanks :) __eou__
So , in other words , there is no quality control in the Software Centre . __eou__
i'm not familiar with nvidia drivers , sorry . in **unknown** , it automatically rebuilds itself when I upgrade kernel , but now sure if a reinstall would be required after an apt-get distupgrade __eou__
: and the correct md5sum of the file , can be found at ? __eou__
I tried via USB and it 's not booting the usb .... the hdd seems to have the boot fault so the only way I see it is network boot , I'll check the link given by SarkMuttleworth ( thanks for it by the way ) __eou__
I use arch on several boxes , quite happy with it __eou__
no __eou__ the SANE compatibility database lists some types of connectivity between SANE and the Scanner as " USB Ethernet " instead of " USB " __eou__
it just halts the process . __eou__ as shown here , the only option is to ' close ' http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/27045/ __eou__
precisely my point . Upstream software is not optimized for Ubuntu . Packages in repos are __eou__ actually , " optimized " is not the right word ... " configured for ubuntu " is more correct . Upstream sources are generic , there may need tweaks for it to work properly in ubuntu __eou__ also , compiling from source has no dependency resolution , conflicts or upgrades at all __eou__
: thanks , I'll try it :) __eou__

MestreLion okay . I'll try that . Do you think I should reduce that to e.g. 150 MB ? __eou__
you say that , for you , crtl+shift+t works the same as ctrl+shift+n ?? __eou__
well , something is clearly not right :-) __eou__
Thanks , I'll try that ! :-) __eou__ installing libncursesw5-dev did the trick , thank you very much ! :-D __eou__

well . you could try another archive as a temporary fix . I just checked again and I have no issue __eou__ try visiting it in your browser . if it doesn't work , it 's probably a network issue . otherwise I would assume you have an APT issue __eou__ " it " being us.archive.ubuntu.com __eou__
The command is actually grub-install . not quite sure how to test if you have it for grub or grub2 though . __eou__
Did you completely purge grub2 __eou__ Having both can cause problems __eou__ I would not use grub legacy myself , I'm not certain this is your problem though . __eou__
give it a shot __eou__ you might need to check in 1997 __eou__
These are two different drives ? __eou__ You can't boot a usb with the ISO and then install to it , if that is what you are trying to do __eou__ This the something other menu in the install gui ? __eou__ You want ext4 click the format and the mount as / and make sure the screen leading to that , that has grub placement is to that usb , not a partition on it but to it sdX X is the usb . __eou__ You can have grub installed to that partition you install to then to not have it in the mbr . __eou__ Ubuntu wont boot from the usb the way you suggest unless you use like easybcd in windows if that is the setup , and the usb , wont boot on another computer randomly with grub in the mbr . __eou__ no problem I would put grub in the usb 's mbr myself , it would still boot with easybcd from windows if needed . __eou__

okay sorry guys i had to switch from NAT to BRIDGED mode in vmware player which required me to restart linux and vmware player __eou__ okay now that i am in bridged mode i should in theory just be able to start the vnc server ( tightvnc ) and then plug in my private ip address in " androidvnc " with the vnc port -> 5901 and should be all set right ? __eou__ i am about to try it out ... __eou__
ROFL ! Yea , I'd just double/triple check your name resolution settings . Maybe cut things down to one DNS server for testing , then adding more later ( who knows , maybe multiple on one line is causing the problem ? ) __eou__
ah ok , thought the kernel itself is the problem __eou__
That 's a good start . How is it looking now ? __eou__
there she blows __eou__
ubuntu-bug update-manager ; I would guess , it can be reassigned later __eou__
if it has a window that you can open , use ubuntu-bug -w and pick that window . __eou__
They added that flavour of kernel in 12.10 __eou__
planner seems pretty nice . __eou__
thanks - its installing __eou__
what partition types are you using ? __eou__
I am loading off a usb __eou__
ctrl+alt+t worked __eou__
that 's good __eou__
su - does the same thing as su root ... it says the password is wrong __eou__
will do :) __eou__
Nautilus was probably bogging down , because it 's doing all of the processing on your computer . __eou__
what vnc client is best ? __eou__
os-prober reports whats required __eou__ my problem is /dev/sda is being reported as no partition structure in the installer ... however it clearly has paritions __eou__ Tried __eou__ shows " /dev/sda/ free soace **unknown** MB " __eou__ w/ no partition table __eou__ any ideas ? __eou__
Thanks ! let me try there . __eou__
If it does not leave the original I would let it finish , usually from partiton to partition the original stays , your risk here in the end . __eou__ Ah moving , I would think if you stopped it you would loose stuff __eou__ were you just getting antsy to finish , what made you stop it ? __eou__
I would do a combination of what bin_bash and BusyBoxes are telling you . Boot to a live cd , mount the file system , and fix the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files . __eou__ also , if the person doesn't really need sudo access ( if they don't have a good reason to install applications system-wide or make system-wide changes) , demote them . __eou__
I just installed ubuntu using wubi , and I'm running 11.10 __eou__
15 minutes now , before when I tried it I waited about 20 before . **unknown** , when i was trying 12.10 it was connected by ethernet , now I'm trying without any internet . __eou__ Tohuw **unknown** : if it helps , I am using a different flash drive than I was before . it 's an intel Atom . if you need more info i can try ubuntu fine , it 's just installing it __eou__
I already installed the fglrx-legacy package ( **unknown** which seems to be " stable " enough ... __eou__
there is no progress bar , I click " Continue " and it immediately gets stuck in the wheel thing without changing anything else on the screen __eou__ it was connected to the network via ethernet cable the first time I tried it today and was installing 12.10 . It gave the same problem . I just connected it to a semi reliable hotspot ( don't have access to ethernet atm ) and can try again , but I don't think that will make a difference __eou__ also noteworthy is that when i wasn't connected to the network , I didn't select the 3rd party or update options , the issue still occurred then __eou__
Tohuw k , I'll install that . __eou__ ah , htop looks so much better than top __eou__ colourful __eou__ lol __eou__ ok , so what am I looking for within the htop output ? __eou__ lol __eou__ It reminds me of my dear old Spectrum +4 __eou__ It reminds me of my dear old Spectrum **unknown** __eou__
I'm not using Wubi , so I'm not sure if this will fix your problem , but it 's what fixed it for me . I would recommend upgrading first and if you still have the issue try this : http://thecodecentral.com/2011/01/18/fix-ubuntu-10-10-suspendhibernate-not-working-bug __eou__
I get " operating system not found " message __eou__
perfect thanks :) __eou__
I bought my laptop 4 years ago :) and , YES ! I will NOT buy another ATI card again __eou__
Very different , but Windows still hosts Wubi . __eou__
I just want my bloody computer to work . __eou__
i'd like something quicker than launching ccsm and drilling down to that __eou__
Switching users takes me to just a black screen . __eou__
I guess I just don't know enough low-level programming to understand why it matters which OS is running . : S __eou__
people use it to PM others and that 's pretty offensive , imo __eou__
thanks i'll give it a read . __eou__
ok , thank you __eou__
: but if it 's 100 elements , it will be too long . __eou__
my goal is to get to a grub prompt so i can follow the instructions here : http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/ __eou__
what version of bash ? __eou__ bash -- version __eou__
: thanks :) __eou__
then there is bug and should be reported __eou__
maybe this clarifys it more : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD __eou__
: lol yeah with me it 's luck ... with you it 's skill ;-) __eou__
No a cd will overwrite the install . __eou__ Honestly I would fix your setup now , post a thread at the ubuntu forums and get some help there as well , you seem to have some broken dependencies . __eou__ 12.10 does not have a inplace upgrade with the alternative . __eou__
Can you pastebin the exact error message ? Both using pastebin , and fixing this , might be easier if you booted from a LiveCD/USB and chrooted in to run commands . __eou__
You're welcome . __eou__ Also note that for iterating through numbers a for loop is *much* more sane . __eou__
pastie the output of " ls /dev/ " __eou__ would you mind pastieing the output of the command I mentioned above ^^ __eou__
Di you found my reply worthful ? __eou__ *Did __eou__
for i in `seq **unknown** ; do echo here is $i ; done __eou__ That 's another way to do it . __eou__
no , I don't. but I want to use vlc . __eou__
What is the partition type on there now , and soes it take up the whole disc ? __eou__
output of ' mount'? __eou__
yes , recorded DVDs produce no error __eou__
, when i use a live usb ubuntu using fat16 i can run from it however if i install ubuntu to the same pen drive boot stuck after recognizing cd rom and hard drive devices . what can it be ? __eou__ , when i use a live usb ubuntu using fat16 i can run from it however if i install ubuntu to the same pen drive boot stuck after recognizing cd rom and hard drive devices . what can it be ? __eou__
use comm instead of diff __eou__ comm -23 tem1 tem2 # report lines that are in tem1 but not tem2 __eou__
what is the output of sudo fdisk -l __eou__ in a pastebin please __eou__
so you mean i do something like sudo apt-get -- nodeps install **unknown** 4.3 __eou__
just tried , it 's not an acpi issue __eou__
hum , ok . __eou__
How can I fix it , with no network ? __eou__
and then shut down __eou__ ? __eou__
it 's similar , FLAC can be flagged , WAV cannot __eou__
should I take a backup of my entire Internal harddisk for this operation . Is their a possibility that I might lose any data ? __eou__
perhaps read http://askubuntu.com/questions/11840/how-to-chmod-on-an-ntfs-or-fat32-partition __eou__ what linux are you using ? __eou__
yeah but once ive done that : resume , clean , dkpg , failsafex , fsck , grub , network , root , system-summary __eou__
thanks for the help , sure i will head to ubuntu forums __eou__
ok ! thank u very much for the advice ... its a very strange bug though isn it ? __eou__
looks ok to me __eou__ did you reboot or type sudo mount -a ? __eou__ type blkid|pastebinit and paste the url here __eou__ type ffmpeg -formats | grep mp < -- addressed wrong guy , sorry __eou__ mp3 is there , it should work , try without all the options , just for a test -- also consider using avconv , same syntax as ffmpeg __eou__ simply type ffmpeg -i infile . mp4 outfile . mp3 < -- no options added , see if it shows the same error __eou__
type mount without anything else , and see if your win partition is listed . __eou__
: should I just replace Ubuntu 's Grub with arch's? __eou__ : hold on __eou__ : **unknown** __eou__
that 's the long-term solution , of course . :-) __eou__
subzero afaik grub doesn't just get updated automatically __eou__
did you do a fresh install of the os or grub ? __eou__
I'm not sure if I can help you with the sound issues . But , you might want to keep checking here . Someone can , I'm sure . Also , you could check on ubuntuforums . __eou__ short answer ? PulseAudio sucks . Longer answer , I'm not sure . Someone with more experience in Audio might have better advice . __eou__ L3top was working with someone on audio the other day ( but I think he 's sleeping or afk right now) . __eou__ you might check back later on ( in about 4 or 8 hours ) and someone might be able to help out . __eou__
no problem . I'm sure there 's a list in your computer also , but I can't remember exactly where it 's at . It should be a log file though . __eou__ If I'm understanding you right , you have one system that 's 12.10 and one that 's 12.04 ? And the 12.04 has an update for Grub , but the 12.10 doesn't? __eou__ did it say updating grub while it was doing the updates ? __eou__ Most likely what happened is that when you finally did all of your updates , it had to update your Grub configuration , because you added a new kernel . __eou__ That 's probably what it was then . Either there was an update to grub itself , and it detected that you made changes to menu . lst , or it was part of the kernel update . __eou__
It 's a start . __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
: that is long list .. and I dont know which one of them is good __eou__
It has to reindex , otherwise you wouldn't boot to the new kernel . __eou__
here 's the link to the information . Like I said , it 's geared to the HD series , but it might work for you too . http://www.unixmen.com/ubuntu-12-10-and-amd-catalyst-problem-solved/ __eou__
thank you that worked __eou__
**unknown** : Ok , I might test if cron is actually working . If that works then I will try sticking the command in a bash script . Thanks for the help :D __eou__ I added this to the crontab : __eou__ valnour , ok that is working now :D but the command I actually need to run , I need to run as root __eou__
Good luck . I hope it works out for you . __eou__

ah ok __eou__
no it is something deeper ... it is present both in gnome and kde ... and both in linux mint debian edition and ubuntu __eou__ i would expect something to appear in some log ... something like a line saying that something strange happens every 30 secs , when i notice the stop ... but i don't... maybe i need to change the log level of some system ( the x server ? ) but don't know ... __eou__

Oh , well , glad you told me . I didn't even know it was a virtual host or client . ... may have been able to give more specific advise . __eou__
i don't see how that would be vnc related __eou__ untill you run the vncserver cimmand the vnc4server does nothing __eou__ login in as one of your users . at the console . move everything or delete the settings files in ther home dir . see if they can loginto x . also test the startx command __eou__
well , I was able to get the size now with du , so now I just need to check in on the size of the destination folder . And I can now see why it is taking so long ... it 's 37 GB __eou__
you'll have to get a DVD . __eou__ there 's a long route that you could take . Install 12.04 and use the upgrade manager . __eou__
yeah , audacious says that no decoders found for mkv + file is too large . __eou__

Humm . I installed the lxdm ( lubuntu ) desktop , and the control panel in there shows both monitors , lets me disable one or the other , but that 's it . Can't disable mirroring or apply rotation or nothing . __eou__
Not that I don't beleive you . but BRB , googling . __eou__
is it ? __eou__
Probably . I've used so many desktops I can't recall what each calls it . But it 's not in mine ( **unknown** installed) . __eou__
you just make a new whatever . desktop file to run wgat you want i belive .... __eou__ all the menu entries are defined by the . desktop files __eou__ well all launchers are ;-) __eou__ most all the de 's parse them to generate the menus __eou__
for example numpy __eou__ right now I use a virtualenv + pip compination to get packages like numpy __eou__
i would guess they are looking at /dev/cdrom not cdron2 __eou__
so what happens if you just run synaptic as a user and then try to install a package ? __eou__
you should do it carefully when you using third party repository __eou__
yes , but root is special __eou__
mkisofs will create an hybrid ISO-9660/JOLIET/HFS/UDF filesystem-image __eou__ From a USB , right ? All of it or just one dir ? __eou__
It 's perfectly safe . The journal speeds recovery in the event of a failure , and increases the chances of full recovery ( in some situations) . __eou__
i used to use it , but i want something local on my OS . something about google tracking all my reads makes me **unknown** . __eou__ also , a lot of my feeds have audio attached to them , it would be nice to dl the audio within the same app __eou__
luckily tho i just need this disk as the go-between from the source to the destination . so the risk there is a little lower as it 's not an installed OS . __eou__
of course :) __eou__
but 12.04 LTS never had this problem , and it 's dead annoying __eou__ Is there any way to stop the error balloon popping up ? the disc works fine , it 's just the balloon I want gone __eou__

I think it is fat but I am not sure __eou__
a standard unix system that you just walk up to , is not configured to allow you to run binaries off a usb stick . you can only do this on systems you administer and control , in which case why not just install the application like a normal application ? __eou__
see if any errors will popup after giving : sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade __eou__
all of them . the permissions in /media are fouled up . not sure why , but nuking everything in there might get you back to a sensible state __eou__
yeah , but I also want to run the script on bsd as well ... __eou__
good :) __eou__
yeah , it was . __eou__
hrmmm =) __eou__ yea i know what you mean - i run into things here and there - more so i think from whats in the containers i play which are random __eou__ but you interest me now with this mediatomb you speak of - and i reallly wanted to get away from running a java app .. __eou__
ok . I could check __eou__ her is a pastebin of syslog : http://pastebin.com/exJgRSsV __eou__ I changed ipv6 to ignore in network-manager and then it connects as I log in . looks like ipv6-sometihing is causing this __eou__
It probably has something to do with having a home already as far as getting it setup have you checked the encrytion wiki 's __eou__ Posts like that have you added to many ignore lists I suspect , at least mine anyway , this makes it harder to get help . __eou__
yw __eou__
As i read in the posts it is caused by the network-manager . Same thing happened to me with /etc/resolv . conf ... I do not knnow more then that . __eou__ In this link there is more about the subject . https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/659817 __eou__
I do what you did search for them , this is a problem if someone wants openoffice instead as they shre some files so a search cleans these out . __eou__ share* __eou__ Sometimes as well the extras are in root so a search from gksudo nautilus is needed for a straight delete , I set my preferences in nautilus and root nautilus as a straight delete , I never use trash . __eou__

oh , perhaps that 's the most recent one ( which I don't run . ) I have given you mistaken information . The only way I have set up fully encrypted ubuntu is with an LVM . __eou__
Awesome , I'll give it a go , thanks __eou__
Nope , mega commersial . Got a license from uni __eou__

nope . It does not give me the option for the hdmi monitor __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1305851/ __eou__ still there or shall i ask someone else ? __eou__
I'll try now __eou__ nope , still there __eou__ suggestions ? __eou__
try a litte searching instead of immediately asking :) __eou__
if you can't find the package ; sudo aptitude search virtualbox __eou__

for the first time after installation ubuntu said to me that it couldnt find any encrypted swap partition , or it was not ready __eou__ later i found a tutorial about it and how to solve this problem . At thos time i have to write a password for mounting it as encrypted ... __eou__ but this needs a lot of time for startup __eou__
trying a reboot now after installing that stuff . Brb . __eou__ that worked . thanks :) __eou__
its what i use but try the cleab commands to clean pakcages and cache restart and try installing maybe they didnt download properlty __eou__
wow .. thanks man one more thing i have slow net connection , so can i install sound package offline ? __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
in Software Settings , do you have proposed updates selected ? __eou__
ah , right , synaptic is open . __eou__ gnome mplayer works fine , thank you ! But I still wonder what 's wrong with default player , VLC , audacious . __eou__
NO . __eou__ I want to find a program where I can draw some very simple mathematical diagrams . Very simple . I would normally use paint but I don't have paint on Linux , and the recreations aren't that good . What do you suggest ? __eou__
" or something " doesn't sound too good when it comes to fiddling with the kernel . :) __eou__
I've never heard of gnumeric so I'll try that . I thought Libreoffice was strictly GUI __eou__
" top " or " htop " or " ps -A " gives a list of running processes __eou__ " sudo killall vlc " i guess would be how to do it __eou__
I've never tried ss so I'll look into it . I really just want to organize strings in a nice easy to read table . i'm not using it for calculations . Do you have any other recommendations ? __eou__ thanks ! __eou__
That doesn't seem to work . I only get " usage : lsmod " __eou__
It shows me some lines about nvidia-drivers that are installed . __eou__ ii nvidia-current 310.14 **unknown** amd64 NVIDIA binary Xorg driver , kernel module and VDPAU library __eou__
ah ;) __eou__ how lightweight is it __eou__ like debian netinstall ? __eou__
NO . __eou__
yes of course . was just trying to throw something in __eou__
It will take to long . Its a do-release-upgrade __eou__

I'll try that , Thanks __eou__
not sure . havent done a windows shared printer in years __eou__
you said you are using ubuntu 12.04 , right ? __eou__
ok , done , the filed as been renamed , should I do anything else ? __eou__
Worth a try . __eou__ Won't work I guess . They don't provide a PPA for 12.10 . __eou__
yes , thats exactly it __eou__ also makes it easier to know when releases are EOL ;) __eou__ 12.10 has some jazzy new Unity features __eou__ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3IpXE2bYv0 __eou__
yes __eou__ I can share a local drive on SDA1 , but SDB1 refuses to share the drive . I see it as a share , but when I double click on it , it errors out with : Failed to mount Windows share , please select another viewer and try again __eou__
because of running applications in full-screen-mode simultaneously . and because i want it that way ( that alone should be enough) . __eou__
so read the link ubottu gave you . __eou__

that output was from ntpdate -d ntp.ubuntu.com __eou__
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsScannersBrother __eou__
Must be a network issue __eou__ Looks like port 123 ? __eou__
Right , but didn't boot after ! __eou__
any ideas of what to look for ? __eou__ what is the process called ( the upgrading program ) __eou__
usually there is a way to do that , but it 's different for every setup . Google should help you find out how . __eou__ that would work . it should be faster than resizing the partition . __eou__
it still shifts the issue from the indicator , is my point __eou__
: 0 __eou__
it 's the same with simple-scan __eou__
jstebbins PPA is the recommended one for that __eou__
You dual boot ? __eou__
sudo add-apt-repository ppa :p **unknown** && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install pidgin __eou__

dunno , but most likely . there 's only one governer , so yah , should be fine . :) __eou__
hrmm . where'd it get that . ubuntu desktop uses dnsmasq ... does ubuntu server not do that ? __eou__
Yeah , I know . It 's so offputting though , the way people decry it so hard , as if it 's an abomination on computing , or that it wasn't tested at all or something . __eou__

Also , this page might help you find the actual way to do it . **unknown** __eou__
k , i'll keep poking at it :) __eou__
I'd guess so , I need both help in finding and installing the drivers correctly __eou__
oh !! __eou__ You should ask in #windows how to get your DVD recongized . Or make an Ubuntu USB __eou__
that 's right __eou__ yes that 's right !!! __eou__ I went to additonal driver and activated the driver and rebooted but still I can not get my akia 37 " to see it . __eou__ oh ! what I did was after install 12.04 server I added the x part by writing xubuntu-desktop . __eou__
what im saying is the button " settings " is there on update manager , but clicking it just refreshes the list of updates __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
ah , hehe . Well , you figured out how to do it this time , so great . Thanks again and have a nice day __eou__
oh I misread you then __eou__
in terminal ? __eou__ you can man < command > in terminal ? __eou__
checked the cables or perhaps sata drivers ? __eou__
boot with a ubuntu cd correct ? what 's is from ALT ? __eou__

Pici , I see git-core . That contains the original git ? __eou__
gitk is part of the git project __eou__ It depends on the git-core package , which is the one you need to clone/pull/push from remote repositories such as github __eou__
They match ? __eou__
just a random set of packages ... i recall there is some plugin to do speed testing and select the fastest one from time to time .. but i don't recall the name of it __eou__
my scheduled interupts are above 30k on average , causing my system to lag , furthermore causing my temp to be close to 100 C __eou__

If you just want to try it out , I'd recommend trying it in a VM or just using the live CD . I don't think Xfce will be still fully intact after an upgrade . __eou__

so how do I register ? __eou__
I got my comp in July , it still uses BIOS . __eou__
yeah I've been using ubuntu for some time now , not as extensively as some , but I know my ways around it , I've never had this problem with my graphics card , since 8.10 when I started using ubuntu . __eou__ I tried to kill -9 the X process number , returned operation not permitted __eou__ ahah , login screen is here __eou__
Sorry ? __eou__
Not really working . Will check google __eou__

what happens when you click " new partition table "? __eou__
I'll let you know how it goes , I'm actually in the process of doing it on my nexus 7 right now __eou__
usually 2 or 3 months after the dev starts , so I would guess around January ( that 's when the 12.04 one started ) __eou__
thanks .. so i'll install ubuntu on my windows as soon as possible ! __eou__
yep ! __eou__

When I separated the disk in two partitions , I created one of 700gb ( for windows ) and the other 200gb ( for ubuntu) , why is that windows took the 200gb partition as windows 7 loader ? __eou__ and PatrickDickey , Really thanks for all your help __eou__
doesn't mean they won't produce the **unknown** ) for Java 7 anyways . __eou__ " not producing . debs " isnt " not producing Linux-compatible tarballs " __eou__
it is more about what can be different ... one moment , I am finding you a link . __eou__ I can't find what I am looking for , but point releases basically have a bunch of bug fixes like a service pack in win , and support a lot more hardware and bring with it the infrastructure to handle those changes , while simply upgrading might not have all of the pieces together ... is my understanding . __eou__
because it needed a partition for it 's bootloader , and somewhere along the lines , it decided that was a good one to use . __eou__ you need to create a small partition for the loader . __eou__
thank you __eou__
It sounds like a driver didn't load . __eou__ look up the specifications for your computer to find out which bluetooth it uses . then google that bluetooth and ubuntu . It should give you advice on how to get it working . __eou__
that may be , but it works good on my hardware . __eou__
a very little lagy sometimes but it 's decent __eou__ minus a* __eou__
thank you ! Although it looks like /etc/nameservers is absent on my computer . Perhaps you meant /etc/resolv . conf __eou__
system reboot/shutdown should be restricted , and i don't know if it is __eou__ ( about to test that ) __eou__
is there any other command __eou__ for bluetooth __eou__
and hola , I agree . SInce he can boot to Ubuntu and get into the Windows partition , I'd copy everything ( documents , pictures , music , etc ) to another drive or USB drive . Then do that . __eou__
Just delete every partition from the windows cd , partition your hdd so you give all the place that you want for windows , install windows , and install ubuntu in the space left . __eou__
which one do you recommend ? __eou__
Cool , thanks . __eou__
Yes , looks like OK . __eou__
yes __eou__
yep , i found that and have a couple others to change __eou__ all done , thanks ! __eou__

Um ... Is there some place I can put it , maybe dropbox ? __eou__
what 's the name of the plugin ? __eou__
Did you try what I suggested ? __eou__ I've given what advice I can , beyond that and it 's probably out of my league -_- __eou__
how many cpu it reports on your atom system ? __eou__
the answer is " nothing " __eou__
I agree , but have no idea what to look for as a solution , I mean , I've stream to my xbox , but from a mac to my ubuntu ? never . __eou__
me neither __eou__ it worked before do-release-upgrade __eou__
mmk ty . __eou__
apparently not , sorry , I could use one myself . My iptables configs have a tendency to revert on their own ... __eou__
i can't get the log to print anything useful , it 's annoying . but then again i only tried it for about 60 secs and went back to x-chat __eou__
ah putlocker thru **unknown** . flash player __eou__
np , oh , also though , I believe 12.10 breaks the amd driver for a pretty large number of older , but not ancient cards . So I think you're supposed to use the legacy driver now or something , it 's something to keep in mind , it 's because of the update to X __eou__
doesn't pidgin do that __eou__
yes , everything going out __eou__
right , how about the output of mount ? __eou__

well what does it say ?

It is used , but I have been testing it while it has been freshly mounted ( to make sure all the space is free) . It funtions as swap fine . I have no /proc/swap __eou__ woops . It shows up in /proc/swaps __eou__
good to know I'm not alonge __eou__
10x :) __eou__
yes __eou__
no sir it works for the first hour or so then stops __eou__
that 's not quite true , if you try to install gimp 2.8 on ubuntu 10.04 , I'm pretty sure it will not work __eou__
No macbook 4 , 1 __eou__ built in audio __eou__
you install . and in the installer tell it to use the free space . but this is not a #ubuntu question , is it ? __eou__ just don't forget to reinstall grub2 afterwards so all show up in your boot menu __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2 __eou__
why would that specifically affect vlc ? __eou__
use connect to server option __eou__
they are . gz files __eou__
I'm not really a linux user sooo x3 __eou__
i agree **unknown** ..... u should try ubuntu first __eou__ and ask ubuntu related probs here .... __eou__ use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics __eou__
Yes sure . Thanks __eou__

your mic input is set to the 3.5 mm input , you have to set it to the internal microphone with the mixer , and turn off mute __eou__
I noticed it in the list , what 's it for ? __eou__
zou get mz msg ? __eou__
yeah it was just bad luck :p __eou__
i use disk utility n when i format it gives me this error : Error creating file system : helper exited with exit code 1 : cannot open /dev/sdb1 : Read-only file system __eou__
what kind of file system does the medium have ? is it a USB flash drive ? __eou__
i'm sure the people in #android know more __eou__
Explain . __eou__
You could also install one of the other linux news feed apps and see what feeds they do . __eou__ muktware is a good site also . They cover a lot of different linux and open source stuff . __eou__
first and foremost ?... gamers __eou__
discussing why you think that Ubuntu sucks is not a support related issue . __eou__ you asked what freedom was . I was replying to that . __eou__ I am telling you to keep your questions and comments Ubuntu support related . __eou__
Don't have one available here . __eou__
I'm not sure . if it 's not on that page , you'll probably want to check with a drupal irc room . __eou__ otherwise , I'd say you'll have to manually install once in a while . I'm not familiar with drupal , as I use WordPress myself . __eou__
or make it in free software way , not discriminating in the first place ? __eou__
Thanks - I'll check it out __eou__
Well , in my case it 's probably long weekend + cable overload => pain . __eou__
... Ok . Then i would probably delete ubuntu first inside windows since it takes a lot of space , __eou__
Yes . __eou__
They collect and send out packages to users . __eou__
its best completely avoided if you intend to use anything but windows __eou__
Not 100% stable ... __eou__
- I assume so . how can I verify ? you mean my $HOME/ . config ??? __eou__
let the interfaces file handle the network management for you , network manager itself isn't rerquired __eou__ I still think the network manager is the culprit __eou__
i7 __eou__
That 's good to hear . So , you can always copy the directory to your system drive , make ( . /configure make then sudo make install ) and then remove it after installing . __eou__ you might go all the way back to / and ls -l home just to make sure that you have permissions . Then work your way down to the gflags-read-only directory again . __eou__
BluesKaj thinks you should use /etc/network/interfaces and skip network manager . I agree , especially if the new cable fails . __eou__
mostlikely what happened is you somehow ran a sound app as root that saved the sound leveles as root . so when the system rebooted it used roots settings . __eou__
sry , not my day today __eou__
i guess ... I should have done some reading first before **unknown** .. Now it became challenging after upgrade __eou__

**unknown** , have you searched your computer model and this issue , others might have had the same problem . __eou__ you got powerfull desktop :) __eou__
well , strange __eou__
in **unknown** . conf it says [ ifupdown ] managed=false so does that mean that network manager is already disabled ? if not , how do I disable it __eou__
is this a computer or a virtual machine , or what ? __eou__
i have put y the preferences of xfce4-mixer the analog card too , but still __eou__
awesome thanks __eou__
I think you choose the text-mode , if available __eou__
Haha , OK then . __eou__
Old situation , honestly . A few years ago ( around 2008 ) one might have had problems with 64-bit setups , but hardly anymore . __eou__
I'm not sure how to do that __eou__
Oh okay . I'm on 12.04 . I also have no idea what the People Nearby thing actually is so ... __eou__
Well you may be able to run WLM in Wine , I dunno __eou__
That'd be " gnome-shell ", not " gnome3 " __eou__ Arch packages aren't encrypted in any way , they're plain xzipped tarballs ... Look at the . **unknown** file inside them __eou__
well it would actual look like network **unknown** . 0.0 which is **unknown** . **unknown** just means how many networks you could divide into __eou__ but a company that would own that many ip addresses form **unknown** . **unknown** would be ISP and a system with 192.168 . 0.0 is network that inside a network behind a router and router handles access to internet and divides bandwidth . __eou__
Make sure your spelling si correct __eou__ *is __eou__ You typed ~/ffmpeg/ffmepg or **unknown** ? __eou__
That space after " remount " is unnecessary ... __eou__ mount -o remount , rw / __eou__

you can run a terminal by pressing CTRL+ALT+T __eou__ I've been around a while kiddo . You'll learn as you use the OS :) __eou__ just covering the bases __eou__
got it , thx __eou__
Is there a kernel version 3.0 or greater available in the repos for 10.04 ? How could I check that with apt-get or apt-cache ? __eou__
After googling a bit , I created a partition called casper-rw ext4 where changes are retained . It started working for most updates . Then started trouble . __eou__
any C library that 's compatible , is what it comes down to . Is tiny libc compatible ? uclibc ? eglibc ? bionic ? It depends on the application . Chances are , if it 's compiled for **unknown** , it probably uses symbols or functionality that won't work without porting to other C libraries . __eou__
I installed the recommended one __eou__
Ubuntu does run faster than Windows ... And most metro apps don't run on 1024x600 __eou__
I wanted to know if they are garbled at beginning or all time __eou__
why ? __eou__
okay , i can try that __eou__ when i get home ... oh , but how do i get myself into grub ? it likes to just boot up without showing a grub menu __eou__ since i can't actually get into my system at the console , how can i get into grub when it 's booting up ? since Ubuntu is the only OS installed , it never gives me a chance to modify my grub commandline __eou__
How should I look for software etc . in Ubuntu ? I don't know how to install other packages besides the ones offered in the Software Centre . __eou__

Thanks __eou__
updating __eou__
Gotta keep your terminology straight . Talk about the correct level of abstraction . It 's blatantly obvious to everyone that software is built as a layered " stack " and that the things at the lower levels are ... well , written in lower level languages . As I said , right tool for the right job . But when you say " media players ", you mean Rhythmbox , not ffmpeg . __eou__
it say 's it finnish but it 's not ? __eou__
Then we can try to fix lightdm or you can just continue on with GDM hehe . GDM works fine , they all do . YOu can run GDM and log-in to a Unity session .. You can run KDM and log-in to a GNOME 3 session , etc . etc . They all work with each other , I've got them all installed on Ubuntu 12.04 . __eou__
allu3do you not have a home router ? __eou__
static webpages will be fine , even on the old computer however __eou__
But when I boot from CD it doesn't ask for **unknown** . It go to choose between install and try ubuntu __eou__
i forgot about **unknown** . thanks :) __eou__
ok , which one should I use __eou__
now I just have to figure out why it 's not working __eou__
yes , so yeah it seems that it doesn't support booting from usb devices . burn a cd or dvd __eou__ version of ubuntu ? __eou__ give in a terminal : cat /etc/lsb-release __eou__ or open your system monitor __eou__
i thought you wanted the ISO ? __eou__
what is the boot order ? __eou__
where can i check that ? __eou__
I know what it is but its a 3rd party app so its not supported here __eou__
i believe so , but i do not know where to find it __eou__
hum i remember having the same once .. dunno what changed but its fixed .. you can also try different torrent programs , like deluge __eou__
it 's copying __eou__
no is ok I was just wondering if it was avaible nixie pixel talk about it I tought is was out __eou__
Damn . Looks like I am going to migrate from Sabayon , to Ubuntu , to get virtualbox working , to migrate to Arch . __eou__ I have to perfect , and rewrite their install wiki , since it is total garbage right now ! __eou__ Is there any way to completely strip unity away , and make the Cinnamon Fork my default DE ? __eou__
yes , that is what I'm saying __eou__ it is also a 12.10 version that I'm trying to install __eou__
I've tried before . It 's an HP pavilion a6109n __eou__
can you explain that to me ? I'm not familiar with that __eou__ but I have a Mac : s But I'll take a look ty __eou__
remember **unknown** ? __eou__
thx will take a look __eou__
press CTRL+ALT+T __eou__
I mentioned it was covered for 5 years , that not enough for you . __eou__
cinnamon buggy on ubuntu 12.04 __eou__
I did it while not working and getting a bachelors degree , hehe . __eou__
no need to uninstall anything ... logout , select lubuntu , login __eou__
Ah , PPC .. Not sure , mate . __eou__
kk __eou__ got plenty of storage __eou__ when the computer boots and I goto my linux partition it goes to a terminal type screen __eou__
no , i'm not . I've never actually tried quemu or kvm . I always use third party stuff like Virtualbox or VMWare . __eou__
Got it Fuchs , so for and it would be grep -E " **unknown** " file ? __eou__
its 12.10 __eou__
so it actually is searching all 3 ? __eou__
so create some small toy example so you can understand better __eou__
lol that was the wront thing i already have 12.10 on my computer just wontdering if there is a way to put the UE 3.4 cd in and get the programs off of that instead of having to download them from the net that was about putting it on a netbook basicly __eou__
im running lubuntu . so no search there ;D __eou__
I'd give it a shot , open your sound preferences and see if it 's registering any input there __eou__
I have a laptop that has the same version of ubuntu on it , and it has just the graphical screen , not the text + dots version __eou__
is it a laptop or desktop __eou__ and what version are you trying to install __eou__ the only thing i can think of that has made that happen to me is hadware conflict like if i put my wifi card in my desktop it wont let me istall or do anything with ubuntu wont even let it come up thats the only think i can say with my experiance __eou__ try taking your HD and see if it boots the live cd __eou__
DVD-RW __eou__
and what network setting is it trying to set ? __eou__ and what is a " lighting control console "? __eou__
it definitely shouldn't be doing what it is doing now in any case :) __eou__
yes , I ran ' update-grub ' after I changed GRUB_GFXMODE __eou__ I wanted the larger size text __eou__
http://askubuntu.com/questions/143050/disable-suspend-hibernate-via-the-policykit might help . Or http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=9346060 __eou__

what about offline **unknown** ? __eou__ what about offline **unknown** ? __eou__
Laptop , **unknown** . __eou__ ASUS Q500A __eou__ Yeah , I already know that . Trying to figure out why it won't boot with " Try ". __eou__
ahhh , it has 0 as group permission __eou__
the destination partition is smaller than the source partition , but the actual disk usage isn't. would that still work ? basically , moving my root partition from a 500gb partition to a 40gig SSD partition ... __eou__
I don't really know . I had a problem with my graphics driver , so I ended up rolling back to fglrx legacy driver today . Before that , my touchpad was working fine and also shortly after the roll-back . __eou__
I don't understand the question ? __eou__ This link https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes describes the process you would take . dist-upgrade repeatedly up to 12.10 , like OerHeks suggested :) __eou__
what do *you* mean ? LVM is a way to set up logical volumes that can be shimmied around at runtime __eou__ and I can't find anything in the ubuntu installer to set it up __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1314320/ __eou__ looking at it after searching for fglrx , seems to X . org seems to be failing to load the module fglrx __eou__ I've tried the beta , gonna try the stable version now , __eou__ will do , I might have most of the deps . __eou__ I'll try amdconfig this time , __eou__
there it is , thank you __eou__
I cannot hear anything from sound test __eou__

That is what I use ! When not playing with ubuntu ... I suggest watch videos from hak5 these geeks travel to Electronics show every year and pickup on tips by FBI and other hackers there well versed in haking __eou__ there are tons of tools for pentration testing .. Mainly require gather packets and decyfer code . Weahter that be hard drive , Dvd Burner , Wifi or boot process . __eou__ Thats allright lost my ArchLinux box do to simlinks changes in gcc 4.7 ... Wasn't doing regular updates . __eou__ crashed the system .. :( __eou__

sooooooo .... what 's the question ? :) __eou__
Oh ! In ubuntu it install dependencies by its own defualt . This is the problem i am facing . I have never got these kind of dependencies issue __eou__

Ah legally yes ... otherwise NO __eou__
I knew it was realtek , lspci gives it as RT8139 __eou__
It did , but that 's just a list of connections that've been used or attempted before , right ?

port forwarding tells your router , " if someone asks for port 80 ( a web site) , then they want this computer ( the IP Address) .. Otherwise , the router thinks that they're trying to configure it . So it shows them that screen . __eou__ http://portforward.com/ close the ad that appears , and then click on Router . Pick your router from the list , and then look for web server ( or apache ) in the next list . __eou__ if your router is a combination modem/router , and it 's not listed there , then you have to find the instructions for configuring it on that specific model . __eou__

That 's not what mozilla 's tarballs are . They provide portable binary tarballs with their applications . I think they're even statically linked . __eou__ No spam please .

yes , typo - I was trying to see if you were struggling with the same problems I am ( ending up in grub rescue after ugprade to 12.10 ) __eou__
yes __eou__
Check http://kubuntu.org for prebuilt images of Ubuntu with KDE , I suggest you just use those if the install is fairly new and you can afford to reinstall . __eou__
Use to run playonlinux about 3 yrs ago and it supported apps as well as games . The site has changed 100% and doesn't list a demo any more . __eou__
so , provided the address is something like **unknown** ; with level 2 i would download only /ccc and all its **unknown** ? __eou__
then why wouldn't minicom suffice , if ou want terminal output ? __eou__
: sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-mysql phpmyadmin __eou__
Thanks anyway :) __eou__
i've done the modprobe , and a iwconfig . It looks like its starting to work __eou__
I didn't tell you to remove anything . __eou__ the : sudo apt-get install libgmp10= **unknown** . 0.2 **unknown** should just overwrite the existing version __eou__ I put a space by accident between the " = " and the " 2 " in that command , make sure there is no space and try then __eou__
never really used it or needed it . i recall some comercial wine called crossover years ago . __eou__
That 's not a support question , please ask in #ubuntu-offtopic , without the profanity __eou__

I believe that is fine , but play around with it . __eou__

I'm on Live CD now . So if I chroot to sdc and install grub there , I need to un-install grub from sdb first ? __eou__
It 's a binary file . It 's an installer for necessitas from their website __eou__
i'm really struggling here __eou__
wilee-nilee Ok noted . Thanks . __eou__ wilee-nilee One last question . Where grub installed is not important as long as I boot into that drive first . Correct ? __eou__
error above __eou__
okey , what do you want ? __eou__
no problem . __eou__
if something doesn't install when you click it , then something is wonky with dpkg ... or you have added bad source repos which cause a dependency problem . __eou__
i think this is a better way https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP __eou__ guys any idea when steam realese for linux ? __eou__ if you did not use linux for programming before try linux training on " google code university " __eou__
Yes , all fine there . __eou__
I went through all my contacts and fixed them , yet one contact now shows the bday two days earlier than it is . __eou__ Yes , iPhone . __eou__
The dates are correct in the Google contacts . __eou__
I have used the terminal a bit , mostly learning Bash Shell Scripting . I don't know the exact parameters of apt-get but I get the gist of what it does . __eou__ PatrickDickey just helped my out , but I think I can manage with other stuff as well . Thanks though ! __eou__
Thank you __eou__
in a terminal , type sudo apt-get install python3 It will install the version that 's already available through Ubuntu . No compiling needed . __eou__
...? __eou__
I can find the $COMP_WORDS and the $COMP_CWORD variable __eou__ I find it in the bash man **unknown** . __eou__
im using an ssh tunnel on it and hostnames resolve fine __eou__
that makes no sense . What are you trying to accomplish __eou__
I believe . If you open eclipse , then minimize it , it will not be consuming any CPU cycles . It will exist in ram . Also , there is a package called preload but it does not offer the user fine grained configuration __eou__
that worked thanks __eou__
I normally do it through a Live CD . I'm not a chroot expert at all . __eou__
good luck guys __eou__
Like I was saying , last time I tried , the ssh connection aborted . :/ __eou__ Next time it happens , I'll try again and be sure to try to do a lsusb and do another dmesg and hopefully it'll give more info . __eou__ 12.04 . I found an interesting bug about irqbalance ... I wonder if it 's related . :/ __eou__ Hmm .. too bad I don't see to have irqbalance . :/ And noapic doesn't seem to work -- **unknown** is I think a thing newer amd cpus use . __eou__ Anyways , I'll look into netconsole if ssh doesn't work again . Thanks for the help . Hopefully I'll have more of an idea if it happens again . __eou__
just copy/paste what you asked in this channel , and give them all the info you have __eou__
that 's why I threw it out as a suggestion/experience only . ;-) In my case , I'm about 99% sure it was the motherboard , because I moved the drives to the new computer and ran them without any problems . __eou__
there is a terminal app for android . there is sshdroid as a ssh server and connectbot as ssh client __eou__
thanks __eou__
or well , lennart __eou__ yeah , I think launchpad is not very useful ... __eou__ how did you debug it , and what did you find ? __eou__
i beleave that won't work on 12.10 __eou__ and kernel 3.5 __eou__ they drop support for this chip for some time now __eou__
just follow the steps ? __eou__
i'm not running it , not right now . You mean the command name ? ddrescue , it says so on that webpage you got __eou__
are there any that won't mess up during compiz effects ? __eou__
I have not , though I might soon __eou__ I'm currently working from a live usb which makes it hard to install kernel stuff __eou__ how do I shut off compiz in unity ? __eou__
I never had any problems with recording my screen while using Windows . __eou__ I switched to Ubuntu because my windows was infected with a deadly virus and I didn't want to net out $200 bucks just to reformat . __eou__
i think it is the x11grab that fails , not the x264 __eou__
I should clarify that this only happens with chrome - if I use firefox it does the right thing __eou__ yeah , already tried that __eou__ the properties _are_ set correctly which is why I can double click the . torrent file in nautilus and it open the torrent app __eou__
it doesn't seem to , but also alt+right click has stopped working . So it might not know I'm pressing alt __eou__
really ? that never happened here __eou__ but i think you can avoid that by removing those unity firefox extras __eou__ whats that ? __eou__ yes , sorry __eou__ sudo apt-get install python-pip __eou__
later ... __eou__
my teacher told us that a known issue was with 64-bits platforms and working fine on 32bit , are you saying that I should use pol and use the windows package ? __eou__
in that case , I'd ask in #ati or ##ati , not sure which one is it __eou__
not sure really . __eou__
How do I get the new one ? This is what is in the repo __eou__
also , I'm having major problems with recent releases when using them via liveUSB __eou__ I at least need to do a backup __eou__
why not ??? __eou__ im running ubuntu 12.10 with nvidia optimus ( from bumblebee ) __eou__
you can make links that include optirun __eou__
yes , I know , but I'm having major issues with 12.04 __eou__
so , what does they do when they synchronize ? __eou__ you sort of saved me . I was using it to store very imp . notes : | Now , I make sure to backup it some place other than tomboy notes __eou__
ah - ok . I'm on 12.04 with nvidia , but not optimus , so maybe a different kettle of fish __eou__
ok tell me how to install it plz ? __eou__
that is the latest __eou__
lol i have hours waiting __eou__
np __eou__
i install lxde coz i have a problem with ubuntu when i try to login and after i put the password and then login the screen monitor switch off then swith on quickly can u help me plz __eou__
after i done install lubuntu the desktop was clean , but my friend play with my pc and i find that home folder on the my desktop __eou__
thank you - i had a feeling the answer to this " question " was going to lead me to a bunch of stuff not just one thing . this is exactly what i was looking for . __eou__
ya see i was thinking more like .. something i can press to get that spaces to view .. like you get when you clik on the unity bar __eou__ so if you just click on the workspace switcher on the unity bar .. ahh ok thanks __eou__
Sounds like something you could pipe into the command , or use grep to accomplish , not an expert on those commands though __eou__
ta-da ! __eou__
ohh you need storage __eou__ hilarious . haha . __eou__
Nope . This ' nm ' is a tool to read object files __eou__
no . you were simply feeding trolls . stop that __eou__
update grub didnt work yup . will try the script __eou__ pastebin.com/25X95RTn __eou__ see how sda5 has the grub on it and is /boot __eou__
Looks like a bug in 12.10 , malkauns : https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/1020830 __eou__
i did read but the reason i chose to have a /boot was so that i dont overwrite the mbr . is there a way to specify to grub what partition it can find the kernel image , initrd etc on so that it looks there every time its loaded ? __eou__
yes , it returns more than one process __eou__
do we need extra drivers ? I see nothing inside that jockey-gtk except for broadcom , aeon-ltd __eou__ do we need extra drivers ? I see nothing inside that jockey-gtk except for broadcom __eou__
it crashes every start up , so then i have to change back into 10.10 __eou__
: thanks . I'll look the log . thanks again ~ __eou__
i think maybe better you waiting for it __eou__
: I just sent 2 links via 1-to-1 dialogue window .. tell me if you didn't receive it __eou__
: no prob :) __eou__
works fine for me __eou__
Hmm , that is going to be a reall big list of files with Magento and Zend Framework on my disk ... __eou__ and much more __eou__
google that ? __eou__ or look at your index . html what does it say ? __eou__
that looks good . That should have synced the clock to one of the servers ( probably the first) , and will keep the times synchronized . It will take a few minutes for the ntp daemon to decide which server to use as master , but after that the time should be kept n sync __eou__
is it just the nvidia drivers you are having problems with ? __eou__
I suppose we need to wait for a fix upstream ? I want to do some Android programming , no 64-bit SDK available :-( __eou__
XD __eou__
atm i installed linux mint ( xfce) , but some people asking me why not ubuntu which might have more features and support __eou__ so there is xubuntu-desktop within ubuntu itself ? __eou__
atm i installed linux mint ( xfce) , but some people asking me why not ubuntu which might have more features and support __eou__ so there is xubuntu-desktop within ubuntu itself ? __eou__
both are official ubuntu distros and are supported by canonical __eou__
yes , from any ubuntu installation you can install xubuntu-desktop and get an xfce desktop , but if you're doing a new install , get xubuntu to begin with __eou__
GNOME Shell is also supported . Yes you may PM me , but 1 : I prefer to keep support discussion in-channel and 2 : I'm leaving in about 2 minutes . __eou__
IME , that is where table info is installed . __eou__
use a terminal to install then __eou__
i just clicked on the apt link from gnome3 : s website __eou__
groups __eou__
so what does mounting mean ? __eou__
@wols thanks ! __eou__
irc ? there 's irssi and weechat __eou__
there are some quite old bugs ( regressions ) I think I'm hitting on the 4965 . Then again ... __eou__ I replaced the bcm4311 ( stock dell ) with the intel 4965 ( not an official dell , but the 4965 was an option for the dell D630) . __eou__ how picky will a laptop be regarding the card stuffed into the mini-pci slot ? __eou__
**unknown** : ~$ xrandr -q __eou__ Did my message send because it told me not to spam ... __eou__
then you'll have a package of **unknown** __eou__
My Laptop get freeze if it is Idle .... Some guys said installing latest may fix the problem . So i searched about the 3.4 but seems the problem still exist(Not sure though ) __eou__
^ __eou__
if you are in X , you always run inside a terminal ... you can't run outside of one __eou__
surely you'd only use : sh in vim on certain occasions , you can't remember when you do that ? __eou__
aah , hmm .. Then I think its best to ask in #debian because I dont know exactly how you can fix this , maybe update your sources list but I am only known of ubuntu .. sorry __eou__
edit /etc/hostname and add your hostname there . then edit /etc/hosts to set ip and domain and finally service hostname restart __eou__
nice . I let testdisk do something to the boot record on my windows partition . Hopefully I'll have a working dual-boot after rebooting . :) ( If not , I'll have a very fancy brick without a cd-drive ... ) __eou__
well no idea about those __eou__ but it deserves to be an app __eou__
okay , you should be able to install it and use it just fine then __eou__
thanks __eou__ thanks __eou__
i have a 160 GB hard drive . it has already 2 partitions : one for windows , and one for data __eou__
yes i get no script or when i click nothing happens __eou__
How do I do that ? __eou__
screen __eou__ well , you can read a tutorial on it later - for now , just start it with ' screen ' in one terminal .... in another terminal , type this AFTER you've started it : screen -A -R -DD __eou__ it will give you an idea of how it works __eou__
do you mean Bauer1 ? __eou__
Empathy just does NOT want to respect my natural scrolling __eou__ and pudgin seems very hard to theme __eou__
I follow escott 's approach too __eou__ use dpkg or gdebi -- make sure it 's meant for your ubuntu version __eou__
not really helpful __eou__
havn't played that much with FC in linux , so no idea ... but I guess it will :) __eou__ read this ? http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/karmic/man4/isp.4freebsd.html __eou__
ok , thanks __eou__ do I have to place the comma or space ? __eou__
happy to ... help ! __eou__
how did you upgrade ? one release to the next or straight from 10.10 ? __eou__
depends how you think about it really __eou__ if you get the debs from the openoffice site then you cna install it __eou__ http://askubuntu.com/questions/85491/libreoffice-base-missing-on-ubuntu-11-10 __eou__
Thank you ! But any suggestions ? __eou__
thanks - i'll give it a whirl __eou__
check for runaway logfiles in /var/log __eou__
I see . Carry on . :) __eou__
Well the usual stuff : cd , apt-get install etc . __eou__
Not **unknown** , no . __eou__
my recommendation would be a linux vm then , in a terminal ssh -X -C user@server . address and launch you praphical needs from that . __eou__
that opens a new tab . I need a new terminal . __eou__
alt-F2 xkill __eou__
you'll need to install and run xming on the Windows OS __eou__ http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/remote_display/xming/images/putty-x11.png will let putty use X forwarding __eou__
I actually dont , that 's the funny thing . Kept getting crashes last week on Thunderbird though ... __eou__
I cant do apt-get remove brasero without it removing the whole metapackage __eou__ finally I said ok , away with the metapackage then , as long as it leaves the gnome shell , so I removed a few things ( lets just say brasero ) and now I have no options in lightdm other than recovery console __eou__
how do i test ? __eou__
well , this IRC channel is for ubuntu support , not MAC / Apple __eou__
my pleasure __eou__
Hahaha ))) No way , man . I like the control panel in the bottom plus 1-click window control and not Unity 's left panel without any options :) __eou__
So if I wanted to forward Firefox i would run ' firefox -X **unknown** __eou__
i found the issue :D i just defined the path to MKIMAGE in the source that required it heh __eou__
That is , normally you plug in the card and that takes over . Only the ports on the card will output video . If you take the card out , the motherboard works again . __eou__ That should be the behavior of ' auto ' __eou__
and my first question ? __eou__
I'm not familiar with KDE so have no idea if KDE 's desktop works similar to GNome . I installed the dolphin and replaced Nautilus . Everything works fine except - my desktop not active - no items on it and no right click and i cant move anything on it . So i try to understand - is it something wrong with settings or Dolphin shouldn't do it at all __eou__
Right , Okay __eou__
integrated stuff , intel __eou__
I try :) __eou__
XFCE came with Ubuntu Studio . I didn't care for it . I like Unity , MATE , or KDE as long as they work . I don't really care which . __eou__ I had a heavily customised Ubuntu Maverick that I've been using for 2 years now and I only just started trying to switch to 12.10 . I have no idea how to make it work and look the same as it used to , which is what I want . I'd like to be using supported software , but not have to relearn how it works and reconfigure it every time a new version comes out . __eou__
it also says " -f archive specify archive file name " __eou__
What are the fn keys you mentioned supposed to actually do ? __eou__ I have an fn key featuring a square with a line either side __eou__
really !? blah .. __eou__
i'll check it out , thx __eou__
it won't run as root .. that doesn't mean you can't use sudo with it .. sudo can run something by any user .. not just root , although that is the most commonly used option __eou__
thanks ... I was looking for on YouTube __eou__
Thanks for your help , it is now successfully running . I had to fix the syntax though : su -c " command in quotes here " - ( username ) __eou__
I'm not actually sure what rhythmbox is called __eou__ Oh , I think you have to use the PID __eou__ If you are using the ' k ' option from top __eou__ 6773 __eou__
nope i disabled it in sudoers myself __eou__ i had same kind of issue with openbox on arch linux but creating . xinitrc file with exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch openbox-session entry mounts all my system partitions but this thing is not working on ubuntu __eou__
how are you running outlook on ubuntu ? __eou__
Sorry to be so blunt , but it 's well explained there . __eou__
I'm aware that it 's not rolling release , but I still find many packages which were updated a long time ago which are not updated on the ubuntu repos . ( see : wine ) __eou__
nope , its fine , I just clean installed 12.10 yesterday .. same indications here :) __eou__
the computer is jsut fresh installed with 12.10 __eou__ removed XP ,, sound worked there though ... __eou__
for cache apt-get clean clears it belive __eou__ all handed by the right apt-get options __eou__
well .... no audio ... and a intermittent popping soundin the speakers __eou__ but i get that drum sound when the log in screen is loaded __eou__
sorry , no __eou__
cant hurt :) __eou__
whats the easiest way to do that ? __eou__
that would get me downloads of fullcircle but i found a couple of magazines on my sons i would like to buy and install in mine __eou__
thanks , but I'm not quite sure what I'm seeing when looking at it . __eou__
because I'm installing postgres as part of a drbd master/slave cluster , and when installing on the slave , the volume isnt mounted so it shouldnt try to configure postgres when the /var/lib/postgresql volume isnt there __eou__
from here : **unknown** as a workaround to the problem described here : **unknown** where solution is offered by the second poster - his repo has similar problem , I tried directly using the . DEB __eou__ are you able to help ? __eou__
like the diaper __eou__ http://stayhomepapadotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/depends.jpg __eou__
sweet __eou__ I don't use compiz . I think its totaly not worth it __eou__
ActionParsnip : while upgrading i was asked a question if i choose lightdm or gdm , a question which was not telling me anything . lightdm was **unknown** , so i sticked to it __eou__ ActionParsnip : so what 's with missing prefs ? __eou__
Thanks __eou__
Alright I'll try that . Thanks ! __eou__
ok , flesh plugin is installed , but the installation of extras keep going .. and its a lot ! do i have to let the whole extras be installed ? __eou__
thanks . I wish I knew how to get that info from the command line ... __eou__
I don't know what nop means , sorry ? __eou__
I was asking because I don't remember the installer to preserve /home when doing a fresh install __eou__
yes __eou__
why wrong ? __eou__
cheer up __eou__
thank you for the help ! I will give that a try . __eou__
you want to use all of it for ubuntu , or leave some for other things ? __eou__
Ok , then I stand with my above recommendations __eou__
sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg . conf /etc/X11/xorg . conf . bak ; sudo service lightdm restart __eou__
thanks __eou__
alright great . what if there is something in /var/lib/mysql __eou__
sure . Permissions still look wrong though , and ssh is picky about those of course __eou__
oh hay that worked , thanks __eou__ that was a typo :) __eou__
chmod a-x **unknown** . pub __eou__ like jrib said , I was interested in the rest of the ssh -v output . But the id_rsa . pub permissions look wrong -- the chmod command I wrote above should fix that . I don't know that that 's causing your problem though . __eou__ perhaps you have multiple private keys on the server , and the mac &c . are using a different private key . Or they are using a different user account on the server you are trying to ssh to . Could be all kinds of things -- best just to look in the logs and find out for sure . __eou__
yeah , I'm logged in ... __eou__
let me find the link , pretty easy process __eou__ http://www.howtogeek.com/114884/how-to-repair-grub2-when-ubuntu-wont-boot/ __eou__
that was a typo :) __eou__
well , if there is a conf file already there , rename it then copy the Ubuntu one in __eou__
Intel macs have a BIOS implementation as well , so you should still be fine ( their BIOS implementation doesn't work with USB on many of their machines , but does work fine with internal drives) . __eou__
can you tell what are the typical changes from ( paths , or anything more ) ? __eou__
weird , that 's how i do it , over ssh , even __eou__
you have X on this machine ? __eou__
I'll check that still can't believe how hard it is __eou__ I can't even install windows because the dvd drive is broken __eou__
like http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/mounting-a-samba-share-933322/ __eou__
no __eou__ quince I assumed vim came packaged with ubuntu __eou__
yes , a Lenovo which ran previous versions with no problems __eou__ thanks for the insights , i checked my power setting and will keep an eye on it __eou__
Could you pastebin the output of " mplayer /path/to/video . mov "? ( assuming that mplayer also fails to play it properly ) __eou__
ActionParsnip : conf files for exim4 , dovecot , openvpn etc . I didn't get " can just rename the original back in ." __eou__
: so its all download now ? __eou__

Someone runs it with ' **unknown** __eou__ The next person does : " byobu attach ". __eou__ Yes , that 's exactly what I'm talking about . __eou__ 00:20 : 19 < jpds > **unknown** : Someone runs it with ' **unknown** __eou__ 00:20 : 31 < jpds > **unknown** : The next person does : " byobu attach ". __eou__ ;-) __eou__

KBentley57 : it 's fixed ! the installing tcl 8.4 has fixed the issue __eou__
Admin in ubuntu is sudo access you misunderstand __eou__ Are you in the account that was made when you installed ? __eou__
Not sure really , but chromium is not getting updates as of now I believe . __eou__
Should be , yes . The error was because that key was missing , and it 's now there , so everything should be fine from now on . __eou__
I do , and I will keep it in mind __eou__ I believe you do . __eou__ is this similar to what you are talking about ? __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
unfortunately according to those post reinstalling grub wont work ... __eou__
somsip , ty so much !!! __eou__
Not really . __eou__
english __eou__
having trouble getting synaptic to start with root privileges __eou__
Ok . __eou__
is it on the repo i just apt-get istall it ..? __eou__
I used to have the same thing with **unknown** , and installing ncurses-term fixed it . Are you on a standard install ? __eou__
i will let you carry on just in minute :) __eou__ yeah , I gues you are good to go __eou__ actually , is it even possible to resize partition that has stuff in it so that the stuff would need to move ? __eou__
lets assume you don't have a crippled system , what is the aversion to a reboot ? is it a server doing the queens works ? __eou__ time to look at the prob being a crippled ext4 file sys __eou__ yes , re-install __eou__ a wubi install does all the disk creating , if you are wanting to do actual disk creation then get ' gparted ' free up disk space and do an actual install , yes you will lose MBR , so what , you got grub __eou__
fsck your disk __eou__
this is why a copy of xp via vbox is always a good thing to keep around :) __eou__
looked for what ? __eou__
also don't have any idea what name I would use if I installed using sudo apt-get install ... this is the first time I've tried installing with a ppa ; usually just use synaptic to mark for installation __eou__ I did do sudo apt-get update ... __eou__
ah - I can't help with 12.10 upgrade issues , sorry __eou__
hold on im going to upload a screenshot __eou__ did you get that __eou__ how do you remove the redshift ppa and how do I get the correct ppa ? __eou__
Already did . =) __eou__
actually I don't even see any grub screen __eou__
alright fixed it - works __eou__
no __eou__ i'm running the script now , maybe i'll do that next __eou__
Yeah I just noticed that while reading the Gimp help file , :p __eou__ Thanks though ! __eou__
well then terminal guy , there you have it , you need a html-strip from my rss feed dump script __eou__
comparing the two dirs/folders would not hurt either , /etc/X11/xorg . conf . **unknown** __eou__
un-mm the outputs , every single one of them __eou__ assuming you done that , reboot , good luck __eou__
it 's not posible for my account )) __eou__ maybe admin might do for me some links to my folder and that will be work ? __eou__
good luck __eou__
it says ERROR : Module php5 does not exist ! __eou__

To connect to any machine that machine have must installed openssh-server and to make a connecton to that machine you must have to install open-ssh client __eou__ * openssh-client __eou__

it will run your script once for each file in the directory __eou__ get it ? __eou__
i would try that . __eou__
I heard kde-plasma-desktop is for minimal .... Let me search qtrazor :) __eou__
maybe this will help **unknown** __eou__
I doubt Paltalk would have that , just a simple way to pass audio to **unknown** , so i can play music instead of putting microphone next to loudsepakers __eou__ thanks for that info , its Almost what is needed . __eou__
oh .. you might want to try some of the recovery tools that are out there .. some can just recover files but I think there might be a couple that can actually try to fix the filesystem .. I don't think any of them are turnkey systems where you can just press a " fix " button but it might be worth a try __eou__ before you start messing with the recovery tools I would recommend making a backup ( if the files are important to you ) or you might end up destroying what 's left __eou__
i browsed the docs a little on their sourceforge page . there may not be a way to set the quit message at all __eou__
you could contact the mantainer , developer or maillist of that package __eou__
my client is into the official ubuntu repo __eou__
yes , i've installed lm-sensors , and it 's the newest version . __eou__ " no sensors found !" __eou__ my cpu is intel-core i3 , i think maybe i need some modules to drive its sensors __eou__

thanks ;) .. __eou__ I've forgot the editor by console for edit the file php . ini __eou__
thanks __eou__
thanks __eou__
swap was done becouse back in the day ram was expensiv and people used it rather then get more memery __eou__
that 's off topic , you need the docs for what ever you want to use __eou__
but not right now , right . I see many more techology in ubuntu being ubuntu-only , more and more . __eou__
lol __eou__
I suggest against swapfile if possible . Multiple Linux version installs can use same swap partition . __eou__
no , no a external hardrive . __eou__
i just want to decompress the file in order to mount it and recover some specific folder __eou__
got it . __eou__
no __eou__
thanks a lot ! i guess chroot will be the best way for now __eou__
I was thinking about arch the other day . Got bored with ubuntu ' release freeze ' policy . Meaning I get to get used to broken apps for years . __eou__ I think those chit chat should move to -offtopic channel and leave #ubutnu for support __eou__
would the computer detect it as a boot device though ? __eou__
I gess becaus windblows always loved to be primary/first in case of dualboot ... __eou__
no , ubuntu 12.10 is the host and I installed windows7 in virtualbox , it worked well before I upgraded it __eou__
no it doesn't __eou__ linux is an awesome server os , and i love working with it __eou__ it drives me NUTS as a desktop OS , and it has for the past 14+ years __eou__
the upstart **unknown** page is well done __eou__
what would be better ? __eou__
are upstart and init same ? I don't understand . I mean init is for restarting the processes after reboot . but I want my processes to restart even after a **unknown** abort . please help . __eou__
what file system ? __eou__
i suggest the 32bit , the 64bit will give a cleaner upgrade path plus it 's installing . Unless you start doing CPU intensive tasks you won't notice much in 64bit , although you aren't using the full capabilities of your CPU __eou__ if you want to stop it , just open a terminal and run : sudo shutdown -h now __eou__ then I'd go 32bit :) __eou__ they can __eou__ they just havent :) __eou__
I have three . 1 : Ubuntu ext4 ; 2 : ext2 ( formerly swap) , 3 : ufs , 4 : swap ( new ) __eou__
i don't think you are duplicating what i am saying ... __eou__
heh i guess it 's a little too vague ... what i really mean is what 's the best low-level laptop for ubuntu ? or where can i " shop around " __eou__
thanks , didn't know there was a #hardware __eou__
no , didnt __eou__
I'm not sure what Khan you're talking about __eou__
why not ? its the first thin we do here __eou__
so easy ??? Works ! :D __eou__ fine ! __eou__
that 's what i was looking for , thanks . trying it now __eou__
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats __eou__
so why suggesting i386 then __eou__
the link I gave is the PPA __eou__ read the link .... notice how it says Quantal ..... __eou__
it is here . so stop it __eou__
thank you __eou__
duly noted __eou__
aaah , it looked like it had finished __eou__
thing is I'm interested in outputting to a PC speaker __eou__
If I put windblows on KVM inside smartos with zfs , yes then . __eou__
yeah i may have to , thanks __eou__
also http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#precepts-for-creating-a-job-configuration-file here it says to do " $ sudo start myjob __eou__ but what does the myjob indicate ? __eou__
disk analyzer it is ? __eou__
Ok , good . It 's just that I've had such good service from xfce across several releases and it 's always worked pretty much flawlessly . __eou__
its the same error again : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1321129/ __eou__
don't have " additional drivers " __eou__
I actually don't know anything about timidity . How do you usually run the daemon ? __eou__
Thank you . Looks like I'd need **unknown** ... __eou__
Intel i7 __eou__
ok sorry __eou__
yep __eou__
ok __eou__ http://paste.ubuntu.com/1321241/ __eou__ thank you ayways __eou__
it 's supposed to have sites-available sites-enabled etc __eou__ This channel is full of Ubuntu users who are just like you , you know . We don't work for canonical or anything __eou__
Hmm , do you use any system that has linux the kernel in it ? __eou__
its already mounted __eou__
does it look like it will mount sda3 ? __eou__
It is playing , you are just not hearing anything from the speakers . I dont ' know why but that is what is happening . __eou__
the backport exists without a PPA . __eou__
it does __eou__
I have plenty of do available . I am not fond of that particular do . __eou__
I'm not sure I understand your suggestion . If root can't even be decrypted , then ' /etc/rc . local ' will never get called __eou__
thanks , but I got " sudo apt-get install lamp-server " __eou__
yes , that doesn't work __eou__
sorry wait a minute : is it possible that 3.5 is develop kernel since the " 5 " is an odd number ? If so , does 12.10 have 3.4 or 3.5 ? __eou__
any ideas ? __eou__
thank you for the link __eou__
unable to locate package __eou__
k thanks __eou__
very good point , I think I'll leave it as it is then , thanks :) __eou__
Got it - sudo apt-get remove skype skype-bin __eou__ Then do what you need to do , then work on installing Skype __eou__ To install Skype correctly ; sudo apt-add-repository " deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc ) partner " __eou__
ohh devy !!! thanks buddy ! __eou__
I just told you not to poll here , thanks __eou__
in regard to what ? __eou__
Whenver I use wget -r , it never works as I want it to ( as I understand it , it traverses all links , rather than the filesystem itself ) __eou__ Any idea how I can get wget to do what I want ? __eou__
the messages were just misleading , no space left on device suggests something different ... ;-) __eou__ guess I need to file a bug in rsync bugtracker __eou__
/etc/default/* are just templates , and they are used to regenerate real config files . therefore , you need to **unknown** . __eou__ and when it doesn't work , you always have your shell rc where set whatever envvars you want __eou__
11.10 goes end of life next april does this matter . __eou__
did you install nvidia-current package ? __eou__
The thing is , if i am not able to find the syscalls_table file , how is linux able to handle them without using that file ? __eou__
only the file servers are available from outside __eou__
ok __eou__
here 's the pastebin . http://pastebin.com/pWBKbtVH __eou__
thank you , but thats the thing , i can't install the extension , now i wanna check the source code why __eou__
any help ? __eou__
a button that interacts with firmware to deploy a reset to default ... yeah __eou__ not really __eou__ you'd have to write a daemon to listen for those calls __eou__
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported personally I have not found one that does not work , but I only bought two usb type . __eou__
then you'll get mixed answers here , don't look at the asus site , find the chipsets on the board and resarch their compatability individuallyu __eou__
that is a tad different **unknown** . __eou__ it is pxe booting ? __eou__
do you not have internet access on the machine or something ? Why did you do it that way ? __eou__
true . but due to my video card ( gma 950 ) I prefer to lover resolution settings . the thing is that on 12.04 all was fine . I'm thinking about bug . __eou__
yes , boot to the live-cd . windows partitioner cannot resize ubuntu partitions properly __eou__
Ok ... Hrm , try installing grub to the second hd , that way it /has/ to read grub first __eou__
how you perceive your own text __eou__
lets try this another way ... what exactly are you trying to do __eou__
you with me ? __eou__
well , my goal is to have /home/<user>/ encrypted so my cache/browsing history etc is all encrypted on disc __eou__ and then to mount in a 2tb drive ( un-encrypted ) to /home/<user>/Documents for unencrypted storage accessible to the user . __eou__
ya but it doesnt remove it , just makes it smaller : c __eou__
thank you very much u saved me loads of time :) __eou__
select the try __eou__
But I have root access ! __eou__
I think I did the wrong /dev/blah , I am doing it again with /dev/cdrom as the wiki says you linked me to . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__
if the md5 doesn't match , you should slow down the burner and reburn . __eou__
no i just want to watch them realtime __eou__
do I just " scp **unknown** :/ file **unknown** :/ file " ? __eou__
no ... but that list might help . __eou__
I am using applications sometimes that use a large amount of connections at the same time , and I have a WLAN adapter on one network , and a LAN adapter on another network , so I was hoping that I could double traffic by using every other one for each connection . __eou__ or is that up to the application layer ? __eou__
I see , ok I'll try that when the installer starts . __eou__
:) thanks , how can i force the -- **unknown** option for each grub update ? __eou__
I can use upstart to stop the dhcp server from starting ? __eou__
Can you get to the desktop , it sounds as if you can . __eou__
alt-f2 gnome-terminal is one way __eou__
i'll try thanks __eou__
1gb __eou__
ok __eou__ if you want help , just let me know . Probably OT so msg may be better __eou__
have you tested RAM ? Have you cleared the fans ? __eou__
that doesn't translate to RAM __eou__ you need to download it __eou__
Cool , thank you . __eou__
It 's an issue with the router . __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1322332/ __eou__ That 's the output of sudo du -sch /tmp /var __eou__ so /tmp is full , must be recordMyDesktop 's fault ? __eou__ http://paste.ubuntu.com/1322337/ __eou__
Thermal grease should be replaced each time the heat sink is taken off and put back on . __eou__
Yea , it 's almost time to upgrade , but not yet .... IMHO __eou__ Rootbrian ( ... from 10.04 to 12.04 ... ) __eou__
I know . :) __eou__
as long as you run linux on it it should be fine __eou__
yes , sure __eou__
I'm sure this is directly related to unity . __eou__
I will head over to **unknown** and have a gander __eou__
it is in the dconf-tools package __eou__
sudo fdisk -l __eou__ what do you mean major change ? __eou__
Trust me , i did long long ago . __eou__
http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/derivatives ( some call them derivatives , others call them flavors , same difference ) __eou__
just copy /etc/init . **unknown** to something else and play with the variables at the top , which should be sufficient to run a process as root without any special tricks __eou__ you then have to register it with whatever the command is __eou__ I don't remember , exactly what it is , but it will set up links to the init script in the correct places and it will start and stop itself automatically at boot and shutdown __eou__ I think its **unknown** c.d < **unknown** > defaults __eou__ run it from **unknown** **unknown** __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
oh :( __eou__
edit /etc/apt/sources . list then __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ did you check your CD integrity as I told you ? __eou__
get off your butt , go to the computer , and reboot it like a pro __eou__ reboot the computer , hold shift while it boots until you reach the grub menu . select Recovery . when you reach the prompt type without quote marks " passwd < **unknown** > " and that changes the root password so you can enter " su " __eou__
from within chroot ? __eou__
so what am I doing wrong ? __eou__
hold please __eou__
did you copy exactly what I wrote ? __eou__
I think I know what the problem is , then . __eou__
I have never succeeded to get it working . But it 's worth another try . I'm using the PPA for it and since it 's always being updated , it should work . Thanks for the advice and renewed confidence , until canonical decides to package a *working* cheese and not some nightly unstable build . __eou__ i'm going to test it once an upload using flash player , completes . __eou__
Generally , in the name of being foolproof , installers tend to actually check whether the CD/DVD source is really a CD/DVD drive . I do know that you can install Debian-based distros from network sources , but the official steps to setting up your own mirror probably result in a slightly different filesystem . __eou__
Pastebin the list of options it gives you . __eou__
hmm , ok . I'm assuming if that 's the case , windows probably wouldn't like it either .. __eou__
please stop __eou__
i got the answer from askubuntu.com , here is the command " sudo modprobe psmouse " . It works for me . Thanks for the info . have a nice day :) __eou__
i've no idea on how upstart works , but try in your home first __eou__
I mean , if 20GB of swap gets written to during a normal session , that 's fine . The space will fill up . It 's really not going to affect the number of disk writes , It'll just spread them out over the 20 gb instead of a smaller space .. __eou__
ok thanks , I will try and see if i can get gnome to do it __eou__
:) __eou__
Thanks :) __eou__
What you're trying to do , have multiple devices accessing the internet from the same router , is how routers come configured by default and should work perfectly fine . You do *not* want PPPoE or bridged mode though , as those both allow only one device to connect at a time ( though I will admit I'm not very familiar with " bridged mode " and may be wrong there) . __eou__
can you give me example on how to use dkpg to start with __eou__
or you use github __eou__
you mean I should install a new software just to change my screen resolution ? I'm sorry , I don't understand . __eou__
okay __eou__
do you know anything about respawn . there has to be a way other than cron . I mean mysqld is like what I wanted . __eou__
so what should I do then ? __eou__
This is out of my reach . Sorry . __eou__
um .. what are you trying to accomplish doing with the composite detail ? __eou__ there 's gui app helpers , like **unknown** , and there 's cli commands like xrandr , xdpyinfo __eou__
nvidia-settings __eou__
Oh , sorry . I didn't notice it . __eou__ You asked your question poorly . Give as much detail as possible in the initial question . At the very least , is it an ATi , nVidia , or Intel onboard graphics card or do you need help determining that ? __eou__
must be some stupid company hosting it __eou__
google " boot-repair iso " download that iso from sourceforge and boot with it .. it 's very easy to use __eou__ you know how to burn an . iso right ? __eou__
you using " nv " or " nvidia ", maybe you should try the " nvidia " driver __eou__
the version is 12.04 and the video card is nvidia gtx 680 __eou__
thX .. and my first prb : i'm using ubuntu classic mode 11.04 with compiz . so if i upgrade to 11.10 will i lose the compiz config ,. if not : will it work fine with ubuntu 11.10 ? __eou__
I have , I can't connect but it could be a localised issue rather than being unavailable for everyone __eou__
yes , that 's what it does . if your VMWAre is DKMS aware __eou__
well , i big suggestion from my side . Some time even if you upgrade , your compiz will not working correctly according to hardware . So , try to install fresh OS __eou__
is there logs there ? __eou__
do I need to restart anything now ? __eou__
What do you mean " a launcher which is oriented vertically " __eou__
do I do anything else afterwards ? __eou__
They only helped me get nvidia-settings . but it worked after I modified xorg . conf saying **unknown** to **unknown** , and then in tty1 just sudo service stop lightdm ; service start lightdm __eou__ instead of Option " metamodes " " **unknown** **unknown** ; nvidia-auto-select **unknown** ", I just wrote Option " metamodes " " **unknown** **unknown** " __eou__
no , but using sudo before solved it , thanks . I'm downloading a new driver , the one I had was not working . I hope it will solve my issue __eou__
That 's what I'm asking __eou__
this is very weird , and I have no idea . But you can always boot using the recovery mode and change this password to something more meaningful __eou__
what is queueing useful for ? __eou__
yes even i installed ubuntu already on D __eou__
I tried the live cd and got these issues too , I thought installing it would help it work better , but I'll try to run memtest __eou__ dr_willis : Where do I get it though ? __eou__
It 's been a long time since I used that myself . Does that actually use 64-bit now ? It used to grab the 32-bit flash __eou__ running " file **unknown** . so " in a terminal should tell if it 's 32-bit or 64-bit anyhow __eou__
I agree . But it 's probably not meant to be configured with a " personal " SMTP server . Rather the ones from your ISP . Or college . Or company . __eou__
Or use a routing solution that implements load balancing and metrics . __eou__
first of all , thank you ; second , can I use dmesg for identifying this issue , if YES , what syntax do I use ? __eou__
what is bad about going to my vendors website to download drivers for linux ? __eou__
yes I have __eou__ and even since , it fails to load the desktop properly __eou__ and ever* since , it fails to load the desktop properly __eou__ it says : the system is running in low graphics mode . your screen , graphics card , and input device settings could not be detected correctly . you will need to configure these yourself __eou__
ok i will try it thank you __eou__ oh , mc is is a bit too light weight :P __eou__
I am getting an error that my backup location is too small in deja dup , but it is 5gb and the backup will only be 85mb __eou__
it sounds like you are putting it in a script __eou__
that didn't work __eou__
trying to remove it throws an unmet dependency error running apt-get -f install throws the error from earlier __eou__
**unknown** : whichever software that is , you might make a backup of it , and then uninstall it ... install libboost 1.46 -dev and then reinstall the other software -- but I think you are going to find that it won't accept libboost 1.46 -dev , so you'll need to get the package from the source instead of from ubuntu __eou__
ok but where is this script ? sorry i am quite a noob . __eou__
hmm its 12.04 LTS :) long term ... yay __eou__
Im not interested in Canonical support .. I am interested in their repos keeping their software patched and upgrade for the entire 5 years __eou__
? explain please __eou__ I'm a bit n00b on networking __eou__
I *think* networking and network-manager are subsystems and the main service is " network " __eou__
no , will do so __eou__
there 's nothing as " nomodeset " on cli on 11.10 __eou__

Why Ubuntu 11 . x is working ? Anyway , If it is bug of ubuntu then it is bug . And if ubuntu community would known where the problem is then they could fixed it . At this time i am just trying to make it little stable so i can work for long time . __eou__
holding the device . Physically sittinig in front of and using the system as opposed to remote access over network . __eou__
I'd say go with leaving windows 8 on one drive :) __eou__

now my prompt is " **unknown** ;\ **unknown** : **unknown** :\ w$ " __eou__

how ? im on oneiric now , but do-release-upgrade does not offer that option __eou__

apt-get downloads software incl . dependencies and does conflict resolution then calls dpkg __eou__
as sudo ? __eou__ may i pm you ? __eou__
^x and it will ask you to save __eou__
not sure why you are asking me , i wouldnt know , but if you can get into a terminal like single user mode you can do anything , i would presume __eou__
you could install over the top but you'll probably get issues . Far neater and more likely to get fewer issues with a reinstall then restore data from backup __eou__ what video chip do you use ? __eou__
thank you - i will follow ActionParsnip advice and add it to , bashrc __eou__
thanks for responding . Nothing returned for either commands . __eou__
Ah well you will get spanked for polling , just a heads up . __eou__
thanks OerHeks __eou__ how do you edit that file , saving with leafpad doesn't work __eou__
I haven't had issues with it __eou__
no , vmware __eou__
and are you using sudo ? __eou__
idk about better , but it is good . realize though that av protection can only protect against known viruses . __eou__
Is this a direct install or a remote ? __eou__
sadly no ( at least at the moment ) __eou__
back leading to this state ? __eou__
the purpose of this is to display to a nonprofit how linux can be made to look like windows __eou__ yeah , but is it a format issue or do i just need a *nix box to do it properly ? i assume the partition doesn't have the boot flag for some reason __eou__ i don't have admin priviledges on this machine __eou__
No , i'm getting a " remove all disks then push any button to reboot " error __eou__

Hrm , sorry maybe I mis-read , but in that case , can't you use a cron . minutely ? __eou__
Cool , I would look up the use of the word sambo it is quote offensive . as well . __eou__
yes . odin is connected via ethernet cable and thor is on the lan . but they're on the same subnet . ( 192.168 . 2 . *) __eou__
yes , the bios is giving some " remove all disks then push any button to reboot " error __eou__ guntbert asked that same thing , i'm pretty sure __eou__
Cool I can't really help sorry . __eou__
no need to reboot , the user must only log out , and log in again __eou__
fedora released an update which would allow fedora to load partially , but before the splash(loading)screen would complete it would drop to terminal with errors , but no command line and frozen ... no keyboard activity ....... anyhow after this wouldnt correct i decided to format and install ubuntu 12 again and work around the unity-desktop --- as per the ubuntu 12.04 install , I am able to load the cd , enter live cd if i __eou__ choose , and start the installer ...... the installed suggests the partitioning and formats then prepares for install .. during prepapre for install then prompts for location to get time zone , then username , and password etc ... __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
have u run the memtest from usb/cd before ? I swear its borked __eou__
groups gives the users groups __eou__ thanks but i know how to add the user to the group __eou__
yes that memtest __eou__
Lubuntu is lighter than LXDE and Xubuntu ? __eou__
right __eou__
It is not the risk here is it can you afford to have anything bad happen . __eou__
xfce is probably closer __eou__
no , to the latest repo version __eou__ my current node . js version is 0.5 . 5 __eou__ I want the latest 0.8 . x __eou__
Ahh , I found it . In the Input Devices tab , the Microphone was muted . __eou__
just suddenly started loading right now ... was at boot : prompt and then just started on its own __eou__
I have Audacity , but I can only record microphone input . I'm trying to figure out how to record the sound output , similar to " Stereo Mix " in Windows 7 . __eou__
what wifi chip do you use ? __eou__
there 's nothing wrong with thunderbird . it just tends to consume an inordinate amount of RAM especially if you have thousands of emails in your mailboxes __eou__
ok , now ? __eou__
you probably just need to pick a gtk theme ... __eou__ or , if you like xmonad , consider using applications that don't have those menus displayed at all :) __eou__ just run vimtutor . In 30 minutes you'll be able to use it for whatever you want to do ( you'll learn to use it more efficiently as time goes on ) __eou__
Read what I said to Jordan_U __eou__
A : That 's not an end goal B : That 's not possible . What is your end goal ? __eou__
nope . They now do urf instead of pdf -_- __eou__
im sorry , what is that ? __eou__
don't the read ones just get moved to another folder ( they do in qmail ) __eou__
i feel like i'm in the posh department store for file systems __eou__
and a journal makes it ... safer ? __eou__
how would they be different to the ISO you can already download .... for free __eou__
sorry , meant to say that to exonarthex __eou__
yea - I've been leaning that way too __eou__
then you might like the features LVM provides ... see the wiki entry I wrote for more info ... but if you just want a separate /home partition , you can get by without it __eou__
perfect . I'll let that run for a bit and take a shower :) __eou__ ah , its asking me Y/n questions :( __eou__
most lenses are : **unknown** ; __eou__
thanks __eou__
that 's sufficient __eou__
sounds like you went thrugh a long term search phase __eou__
oh , duh , openssl is a good suggestion . thanks :) __eou__
yeah . I ahve a machine ruunning 12.04 and 12.10 .. both have issues , lol . You may be right about the running things from terminal . I __eou__
good for you .. only have 10 .. i have like .. 30 to 50 .. __eou__ especially when they know that you are already on a higher levels . __eou__
click lcabreza __eou__ teasing anyone who cares x ) __eou__
not there , /etc/default/grub is the file to change __eou__ make sure when you are done editing that file you run update-grub and update-grub2 when you are done . __eou__ that file setting forces a hidden timeout , if you set it to 1 its one second , if you set it to 5 its 5 seconds . and it runs unseen forcing the OS to load without notifying the system __eou__ np . __eou__
not really __eou__ when i work , sometimes the computer freezes , the music keeps playing the mouse moving but no response __eou__ i have to hardreset it __eou__ i cant switch to terminal windows from gui control alt f1 __eou__
" last user1 " shows you if the user still is logged in or not . __eou__
can't grep it here . ps axjf | grep user1 __eou__
i don't think so . the two commands that get executed regarding the ' find ' return nothing at the moment __eou__
#python __eou__
i believe , and this is just my personal opinion on this , that encryption is a measure mostly useful against offline forensics __eou__
Already done . Still does not seem to work for me . __eou__
overclucker , yes that seems a good way . __eou__
and encrpyted home is working fine without any issues , so its a very good way i think __eou__
thanks __eou__
yep , thats the same as my issue __eou__
- yes , i installed using apt-get libmysqlclient15-dev __eou__
ok __eou__
ok got it __eou__
this is exactly what I want . good . thanks __eou__ how do I install this supervisord ? __eou__ kushal_kumaran , take a look at here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8279848/supervisord-adding-multiple-processes-for-php-and-gearman . where exactly is he writing the conf file . I mean which dir ? __eou__
can't open synaptic getting error __eou__
it installed some packages .. but same issue __eou__
yeah , i'll do :) __eou__
there are plenty of ways to do that . one would be to have each process create a pid file in a directory , and then write a script to collect process information for each pid file in the directory . __eou__
can also right click > paste . __eou__
I recommend a liveCD . __eou__
i erase all previous kernel , sorry i dont __eou__
bug ... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/biblatex/+bug/995447 __eou__
probably , yes . Strange that it would lead to a kernel panic , though . Haven't had one of those caused by software error ever before . __eou__
the " upstream " of a given software is the original developer of that software . When we say a bug is an " upstream bug " it means the bug is present in the original code , it is not a fault of ubuntu 's integration __eou__ and " forward upstream " means " instead of just reporting the bug to Ubuntu , also report it to the original developer " __eou__ no , Ubuntu is based on Debian , altough some software in the repository may have been developed by Red Hat __eou__
that 's what I did ... and apt-get install -f is only listing the dependencies that the deb has , it does not mention the deb itself __eou__
yes __eou__
http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1200 or speak with mhall119 on IRC . __eou__ I will ask you one last time to please take offtopic discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic __eou__
right-click it __eou__ right-click it > " Lock to launcher " __eou__ both xchat and xchat-gnome are gtk apps , not console ones . You can use the terminal , but you don't need to . You can always use the dash ( Ubuntu 's " menu " ) , like any other software __eou__ so what ? there 's still an icon for its window in the launcher __eou__
I saw :( __eou__ so I suppose ubuntu should do the same ? __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ that 's a typical example . Nothing happens __eou__
actually does http://paste.ubuntu.com/1326124/ __eou__
i just want it on bottom __eou__ what ? __eou__ i find that very very very very very very very very very very very very very very hard to believe __eou__ just saying , you know ... open source stuff is hardly " locked in and you can't change it " __eou__ i don't want to . i want to use Unity , but i want it at the bottom __eou__
Oh ok , I don't really know i'm still on core duo lol __eou__
okay __eou__
, well i've used before xchat-gnome which is different project then the original xchat for linux __eou__
all due respect ... once I figure out how to get 9.10 on this thing I won't need support . It'll be the novelty tablet that I jot notes on and such __eou__
probably very fast , as fast as the USB speed is , 48 megabytes per second ( 480 megabits is the rating ) __eou__ I believe USB is faster than **unknown** . __eou__
there is not a problem in windows system __eou__ : there is no problem in IP assigning , if it is then it resides just in conf files __eou__
sudo ufw disable ( run this command at your own risk as it completely disables the firewall . NOT RECCOMENDED ) __eou__
its amazing that use to be cutting edge specs not to long ago __eou__
IMHO you are completely uneducated about what " security " is __eou__
: Yes I can for the first time when the connection is established __eou__ It shows host unreachable __eou__
albeit the configuration of them is similar __eou__ yes , but if you have like **unknown** , it takes a while to get all of them executed at the same time __eou__
yea but he could nmap my ports and use another program to crack if i have open ports **unknown** ? ) __eou__
sure , it just needs ssh __eou__
The ide ... __eou__
knowing your IP is not an issue ... you use your IP for any service you use on the net , so consider it a public information __eou__ and anyone can run nmap on that IP .. again , no big deal , provided you have a sanely configured machine __eou__
those are internet services , which by definition must run *outside* your router . __eou__ you can't run them in your machine __eou__ privacy when surfing the web has nothing to do with IP proxyinng __eou__
okay , so what would be a more serious outside threat ? :D __eou__
there are exploitable hacks for irc , yes __eou__ if you think he has your ip address log into your router and release your ip address from your isp and get a new one , then all his efforts are for not __eou__
For applications ? Whatever the default is __eou__
to generate an instalablle USB key you do ... for installing the system in the USB you don't __eou__
please guide me any tutorial is there __eou__
yes i saw and corrected that bad statement . but thank you . __eou__
Good boy ;) and how did you find that out ? __eou__
**unknown** : whats going on ? __eou__ yea once i finish studying python , and web design I want to take a look into 3D modeling __eou__
repeat your last message , they didn't egt it . __eou__ k __eou__
i guess in most cases it doesn`t make a difference if you use ap-get or a frontend , because most of the people just want to install a simple tool :) __eou__ ohh ok , didn`t know that this bug was such high critical , thanks for the info __eou__
well yeah , that 's how wikis work __eou__ then make an account , or report a bug __eou__
thanks __eou__
there is disk analyser in dash if memory serves . You already know the space though .... __eou__
eh ... more set than I was . I got 301 Moved Permanently , but that 's a separate problem :) __eou__ night ! __eou__
YAY ! I tried install davfs with no hints or anything . __eou__ davfs2 seems to be very good . __eou__
i think so __eou__
its hard to tell . Have you tested a similar setup using 12.04 ? __eou__ you may also remove the ati proprietary and use the free source drivers , and see if the mouse still hangs __eou__
non-sudo commands work fine ? __eou__
awesome ! :) __eou__
some kind of file system error on my root mount __eou__
I can't while using unsopported drivers __eou__
by the way , the url you posted for davfs is from dapper ... that 's 5 . xx iirc __eou__
you provide a path to chmod , . **unknown** is fine __eou__
What do you mean ? __eou__
your misinterpreting my issue . I need to format this flash drive and can't. __eou__ Gparted ( common tool ) gives me an error and then crashes before creating a new partition table . __eou__
yes ... are you on ubuntu ? Why are you skimming and googling , just use the keystrokes I said above __eou__
yes reading now .. seem I've to get the sources . __eou__ I am compiling a source which requires this lib . __eou__
so do I just paste that code in to the beginning of the script ... ? __eou__ sorry experienced linux user , very very novice coder ;-P __eou__
nah its command line __eou__
that doesnt seem to do anything __eou__
I assumed that last time and that didn't work out too well __eou__ I'll see how it goes *grabs his W7 disc* __eou__
sudo : . **unknown** : command not found __eou__
12.10 __eou__
what *buntu and/or DM are you using ? __eou__
oh I was under the impression it would my mistake . __eou__
I will have to check if godaddy allows that __eou__
err .. read that url ? they give the exact fix .... __eou__ If your desktop displays the files of your /home/ and not the files on your real Desktop path , you probably do not have an established path " Desktop ". To fix this please do the following **unknown** __eou__ my **unknown** . dirs file is here --- > http://paste.ubuntu.com/1326964/ __eou__
It is written in C++ which I don't have good knowledge about . __eou__
Yes I could do , but then I lose the connection to the chat __eou__
thanks __eou__
! ppa __eou__ the pcmanfm docs at wiki.lxde.org mention the Desktop Path and your exact issue . __eou__ wiki.lxde.org/en/pcmanfm/#desktop_path __eou__ http://wiki.lxde.org/en/PCManFM Desktop Path section . ;) __eou__ err .. read that url ? they give the exact fix .... __eou__ If your desktop displays the files of your /home/ and not the files on your real Desktop path , you probably do not have an established path " Desktop ". To fix this please do the following **unknown** __eou__ my **unknown** . dirs file is here --- > http://paste.ubuntu.com/1326964/ __eou__
That 's Jetty 6 __eou__
Still far too much to put on a DVD . __eou__
/etc/init is full of . conf files .. I put my ttyS0 . conf there .. just this ? __eou__
That 's exactly what I've just done :) Thanks __eou__
mint is using ubuntu __eou__ mint channel dead __eou__
Honestly , fuck it , i'll just manually install Jetty 8 __eou__ thanks __eou__
i have tryed , but i think i missing little think . __eou__
: i dont want to develop application __eou__
You're saying , if I'm not in a screen it'll do nothing ? __eou__
i followed the instructions to boot from an iso but grub is not prompting me to select where to boot when the computer starts . it just has the computer splash screen __eou__
mm darn ,, I just havent used ffmpeg for this for a while ,,, did you google the error ? __eou__
you can ask the arm guys if there is a rom . #ubuntu-arm __eou__
there are alot of people that install ubuntu to their tablets , and phones . __eou__
I don't see why you would need a swap space . But since you have a hdd , there would be no adverse effects of having it except the losing the space . __eou__
i used the same disc and same USB to install it on my macbook air __eou__
I would ask in #ubuntu-server if you get no answer here . __eou__
so there is another way not to make format ? __eou__
https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/quantal/xinput-calibrator/ __eou__
that was the first thing i tried .. there 's no terminal application , and ctrl-alt-t does nothing .. __eou__
I want to run a phantomjs scripts on my linux box , I have downloaded it and just want to run scripts . __eou__ i can runt it now but for that I have to give a absolute path of phantomjs while running script from anywhere on machine . __eou__
i rightclick on the speaker icon and I open " Sound Settings " Over there in the Input tab theres nothing really to enable __eou__
I was kind of reading about xrandr . Maybe there is a way to set a ' preferred ' __eou__ When using my TV it likes to auto select 1366*768 . quite irritating lol __eou__
that doesn't make it ubuntu related at all . sounds more like something for #electronics or #hardware __eou__
sde would be the 5th disk . __eou__
doesn't work tryed that __eou__
I have never used that tool , I am creating backups with my own scripts , fitting my personal needs . __eou__
I am under windows at work , it appears I have hit this problem http://askubuntu.com/questions/173457/usb-wi-fi-netgear-wnda3200-unable-to-allocate-urbs-error __eou__ thanks anyway ... lol just got to run a wire to see if I can get a kernel update to get the wireless to work __eou__
how should I try __eou__
Im reading it , wait __eou__
no delay , unless i'm experiencing a very pleasing chorus effect , but it couldn't be more than 10ms i doubt , else i'd be able to tell __eou__
pc , Alienware X-51 __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
Yes , i know . But I need to pid for the process that 's being started __eou__
what ? Why is there suddenly a " pid file " involved ? __eou__
12.10 __eou__
please re-read what I suggested . it does not use sudo . __eou__
downloads information about available packages __eou__
and make sure they're all unmuted ( press ' m ' so there are no " MM " items below the mixers ) __eou__ I missed the part where you said what you were trying to do . record , play sound ? __eou__
dont remember the actual message but it was something like I need to contact to admin __eou__
that should suffice if the port forwarding was done correctly __eou__
this is what I get " ssh : connect to host localhost port 22 : Connection refused " __eou__
if you got a spare small hard drive you could image the ISO file to the HD plug it in . boot from it then install to a differnt HD i guess ... __eou__
Download the wubi . exe from another machine and put it on a USB drive . __eou__ Make sure that you have the wubi . exe and the Ubuntu iso in the same directory when you open wubi . exe , otherwise wubi will try to download the iso itself . __eou__
I port-forwarded . __eou__
normally you just select the disk in the file manager list and it auto-mounts it .. UNLESS the filesystem is currupted or needs checked it should auto mount . __eou__ or you can mount it by hand . __eou__ mounting is rather .. well .. staight forward ... __eou__
huh ? __eou__ to my understanding both are windowmanagers/desktop environments/whatever you call it . not one based on the other __eou__
i dont know .. its a display issue - something flashed when i did ctrl alt T , but no terminal appeared __eou__
how do I install them ? __eou__
no problem :) __eou__
or wilee-nilee ? __eou__
yep its there :) __eou__ its something strange really :( __eou__
so just remove "" and that 's it ? :) __eou__ and say > run " **unknown** " ? __eou__
ok :) __eou__
dont think its a driver issue cause its been working fine until i tried installing a dnsproxy __eou__
Please pastebin the output of " mount ". __eou__ If you know , then why did you try to run matlab as root ? __eou__ Bingo :) . Add an fstab entry for that partition , or if you already have an fstab entry remove the " noexec " option . __eou__
whoa .. must be new __eou__
usually " sudo apt-get install -f " works for me though it has been awhile . __eou__
I've had some success with rtorrent but never tried transmission __eou__
useless , as usual __eou__
they are listed in the SMART status __eou__
that 's why they say it ... the more writes , the faster it wears out ... __eou__
the whole thing __eou__ I just use my big rotating drive for storing music and videos __eou__
that 's logo not mascot ! __eou__
oh ok . They should do small variants of tux then . I think it would be cool . Like have tux with circle of friends tattoo __eou__

https://gist.github.com/0d8fcf074c9f4a9c669e right , so , anyways , the link is in place ... why don't either work now ? __eou__

if it wasn't mounted you wouldn't even get a shell __eou__
sudo apt-get install zram-config __eou__
well i don't have problems when connected ... only like this .. I download large files with constant speed of 20Mbit/s over night and no problem at all . Just like this ... can't find my network .. and this time i can't really fix it .

for 3d acceleration ? braid was painfully slow when I tried it __eou__

any ntfs partition has it , solved . __eou__ maybe this page is any help >> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/Nokia __eou__
I have been able to hold down shift and bring up GRUB , and entered into recovery mode , and when I enter into the low graphics mode , the xserver log file says it can detect a screen but found none with a useable configuration , then goes on to say a fatal server error has occurred and no screen have been found at all , telling me to check a log file at " /var/log/xorg . 0 . log " I have no idea how to check this specific log file ! __eou__ when I use no mode set i still get a black screen , so i am unsure how i can investigate said drivers ... __eou__
here is the crash log __eou__ http://pastebin.com/N5TbSJs6 __eou__ purging googleearth7 __eou__ hope soon fix __eou__

That seems to have worked , thanks __eou__
Yes , and hbo 's hbo go page doesn't say anything about linux . __eou__

thanks . I'll go check with the disk usage analyzer . I'm fairly certain that 's a good estimate .. thanks __eou__
It says " quantal ". But when I login initially it always shows 12.04 . I believe I am in some weird partial-upgrade hell . System is usable , I just can't install or remove anything via apt-get . __eou__
Then why dont you use it ? __eou__ There is NO default xorg . conf since ages . If you need it , create it . __eou__
great __eou__ no luck __eou__

No reason , really . Just finding a folder to install programs in . What folders is ' standard ' for installing programs in ? __eou__
Nice . __eou__
you should not tell people to read the effing mannual or at least give Links __eou__ that is against the COC __eou__ all I am saying is that your commet to RTFM is not a good one and helps no one __eou__
i have a feeling its the gnome ppa i added yesterday , im not sure how to remove it __eou__
no idea . the prolog binary should be in some bin dir . but its support dirs .. not in bin __eou__
well I would like to fix it for sure . I started to get quite dependent oin it after 12.04 , and it is a little disappointing atm . I will check that link and see what I can provide ? __eou__ I think I might do that as a last resort , as I would have to go on a learning curve . In the meantime , I think I would like to resolve ? Just a time thing tbh __eou__
i need someone to fix my audio problem though __eou__
adjust icon size . does this help . Some images are bigger and cant display in smaller desktop settings . __eou__
share desktop __eou__
no the hosting thing you have to buy not sure what it is __eou__
i'll try __eou__ i do not understand your : find -name " **unknown** " -type d -print 2>/dev/null , but with the ' locate prolog ' of **unknown** i get ( amongst many other like these ) **unknown** 6.6 . **unknown** . pl __eou__
where __eou__
didn't you plan before-hand to upgrade ubuntu before support ran out ? __eou__
geany might be as close as you get to dreamweaver . some people might use eclipse . but even something like gedit , emacs , or vim could work __eou__ but I don't know of anything of the top of my head that does code completion and site synchronization __eou__
how to install it using terminal __eou__
sudo sh **unknown** 12.10 **unknown** . x86_64 . run __eou__ not for a long time __eou__ Steam are/have released Steam on Linux which is cool , but i dont know of any big AAA games natively ported to linux __eou__ commitment you have is admirable :) __eou__
I am new to ubuntu and i am just choosing a random folder to install Java . Anything but /home/username goes , really . __eou__
yeah i actually from Arch :) ubuntu is the server of choice :) __eou__
i saw on youtube more ram made the game load more smoother __eou__
thanks for that i will check it out :) __eou__
i don't get it . if the user doesn't give the root password . how do they update the software or security of os __eou__
Yes . __eou__
( I know , but I was hoping others that weren't aware would become aware by reading the responses ) __eou__
No it 's just a normal TV , I just am using a small PC as a media centre __eou__
no , newer releases use ufw , which blocks ports __eou__
I think it is a case of my isp blocking the irc ports . 80 , **unknown** , 22 all work correctly . __eou__
its a simple text file . __eou__ example ( 2 lines ) xterm & exec icewm __eou__
i don't htink it 's lazy . It 's a taste thing . Some systems I like the snapshots , sometimes I do periodic rysnc backups . __eou__
sure __eou__ going there now __eou__ Sure going there now __eou__
It was only booting to windows , yes . So I used EasyBCD to ass an entry for ubuntu to the windows bootloader , and when i try to boot there , it complains about missing or corrupt files __eou__ I'll check that out . I'm nooted into the live CD atm __eou__
Is it possible to send from here files ? __eou__
wat do u mean about bad advice __eou__ he asked me how to run the file and I'm telling him __eou__
i'll google them __eou__
ah kk __eou__
ok , and the fglrx drivers from ubuntu have no hdmi sound ? __eou__ why would they miss those ? __eou__ note : fglrx , not radeon __eou__
If you have the right firmware on the jet direct card you can **unknown** from it still ..... I know . Doesn't help much . __eou__
you can do some sneaky deployment tricks with git , too ;-) __eou__
I've heard of it , but haven't tried it myself yet . __eou__
Hey well they run the code for Mac using linux kernel and port windows games to mac users now . So they big money now . Get all the richy rich kids that could careless to hack computer games . __eou__
shame was hopeing they would release it after widnows 8 __eou__
You have missed my point , just 7 months into 12.04 it seems like a phetish to upgrade , not so much use it for 5 years . __eou__
yes __eou__ I don't know a simple one . /dev/sdaX /home ext3 0 2 these are not spaces in between but tabs btw __eou__ no messing . try to press ctrl+alt+f1 on your ubuntu and log in there first . might actually work __eou__
thunderbird dir __eou__
when I check it - it immediately unchecks . Ubuntu is babysitting me too much :( __eou__
Java7 you have to get from oracle it is easy . __eou__
I did . it had weird options : primary disk , C : drive , CDROM , floppy __eou__ I'd have thought C : drive and primary disk were the same , but idk __eou__
yes . at the addon manager there is a botton right next to the search textbox . __eou__
RV610 ( Radeon HD 2400 PRO) ... driver=radeon -- does this mean anything to ya ? __eou__
just checking if it 's actually installed __eou__
thanks __eou__ all I really needed to know was whether there is any good reason to use the proprietary one __eou__
run mprime , or cpuburn and measure again . it will go up __eou__
i see , thank you __eou__ i have an actual question i have been thinking about , lets say you have a server running an older version of ubuntu , is it consider good practise to distro-upgrade ? or would it be better to have a clean slate ? __eou__
that doesn't explain it . you can write your mouse config there without doing X -configure to create a full blown config __eou__
ubuntu 12.10 __eou__
OK sorry __eou__
So those errors would show up like that on any platform ? __eou__
in /etc/rc **unknown** ? __eou__ i couldn't remove it __eou__
what is your question ? __eou__
I don't have the iso sorry , but I've started the download __eou__
yup __eou__ why not just use **unknown** then __eou__
**unknown** , everytime sound teribly distorted . like a alien . __eou__
I will try to rescan sensors one more time , but this settings shouldn't be overwritten during upgrade from 12.04 , in 12.04 fan works properly . __eou__ **unknown** : There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed ;] __eou__

I see __eou__
in the menu system is " Restricted Drivers " or somesuch __eou__ " Additional Drivers " maybe ? __eou__
did you read *anything* I said ? __eou__ clearly not __eou__ I can set you up an account on this machine , give you sudo access and let you bang away with sudo rm -rf * anywhere you like __eou__
well , what I did say earlier is in the trivial case it 's set up to function a bit like su but without disclosing ( or requiring ) a root password __eou__
yeah , but im hoping to jump the fence at its lowest .... __eou__
you have to something to do with setting WPA_SUPPLICANT to true to let it be managed by network manager __eou__ what chipset is it ? __eou__
drop it . __eou__
if you consider your " question " sensible , then you need to ask ubottu about ! gq __eou__
ohnp __eou__
i have only single account which account type is administrator __eou__ #doh __eou__ i didnt unlock it :D __eou__
Not sure I have never used it . __eou__
everything i need is in my dropbox __eou__
it already downloaded the packages , but within the natilius-dropobox package there is a download that it is frozen in watch ill show you __eou__ heyActionit is to late __eou__
you might be able to pastebin the log to see if someone here can assist __eou__ can you pastebin the output of ' **unknown** __eou__ best let it go __eou__ reinstallation is probably the only sure way __eou__
you shouldn't -- this is very interesting __eou__
tbh I don't know __eou__
his opinion that arch is better , no problem . Him giving you **unknown** , unacceptable . __eou__ which was lies . __eou__
bitcoin . **unknown** __eou__ wilee-nilee : bitcoin 0.7 . 0 __eou__
have you installed mysql before this ? __eou__ one thing at a time - you have to fix APT before proceeding __eou__
Apparently , but I still don't know how __eou__
yes __eou__
I found something called " **unknown** " in the repo , trying it right now . I don't want to pay attention , I'm lazy . __eou__
I havent read it , to be honest . __eou__ easytag __eou__
what kind of things end up breaking ? __eou__
usually you'd work on the development version ( raring ) and eventually backport it to quantal __eou__
" Scan files " :) __eou__
FATAL -> Failed to fork . 0% __eou__
all I can recommend is remove all nvidia packages ( except nvidia-common ) then reinstall nvidia-current then reboot __eou__ have you checked the cooling on the card __eou__ what part is causing you confusion ? __eou__ there will be a cooling solution on the card , check it is clear of fluff and junk __eou__
Try going to that link I gave you to download ATI driver . If that wont solve the problem do it as I said before , fresh install . __eou__ Or problem even could be because of AMD 's bad support for Linux drivers . I even had a problem back in Ubuntu 10.04 with my NVIDIA drivers . __eou__
seems weird to be using /root for log files . __eou__
not me , the company i work for __eou__
yes __eou__ i'm on the unity desktop i wanted to try out the kde , so installed it and now i want to remove kde again __eou__
thanks yall __eou__ figgered it out : > __eou__
Memory __eou__
I am searching __eou__
thats cool , but not if i dont even have a print screen button on this mac haha __eou__
so .. no __eou__
no i use unity and i installed kde-full package __eou__
i dont want to use a usb because it 's impossible to permanently insert malware into a dvd-rw __eou__
oh , cool ... __eou__
I should __eou__
Okay , I'll try that __eou__
where are those ?? __eou__
How __eou__
lol __eou__
How can I get stuff _really_ deleted ? Purge doesn't seem to do it . With apt-get I mean . __eou__
Ok . Let me try that and see if Ubuntu GUI sees my partitions . I'll let you know shortly . __eou__ DIdn't work . Hmmm .. let me just do a clean wipe of the entire HDD and come back in for a 2nd installation and see if I can see my partitions . __eou__ Thanks for helping out ActionParsnip ! __eou__
Good stuff . __eou__ Not sure about the splash screens . I've never installed KDE in ubuntu . __eou__
Check samba logs ? __eou__
xsplit seams good because u can really tune the quality __eou__
You it doesnt need bare metal , while it is designed to run on bare metal :) __eou__
: i wanna run esxi 5 , i hope vmware server does not supports it __eou__
kvm support **unknown** ? __eou__
how about he answer ? __eou__
it worked well with windows7 on vmware workstation __eou__ 2 esxi for making a HA & DRS cluster __eou__
thanks , did that but what i needed to do it for failed __eou__
gotcha __eou__
I will respond next week __eou__
I'm worried that something might mess up if i switch lol __eou__
righto , just checking ;) __eou__
< ActionParsnip > i get alot of lines ... heres one line product : RS880 [ Radeon HD 4200 ] __eou__ heres the pastebin http://pastebin.com/2hqDwvFi __eou__
" tomreyn : cornell : this was cut iff behind : ( and it 's a bit hard t " ? __eou__
aha , install worked after I mounted and passed the -- boot-directory flag to grub-install . gonna see if it boots up . If it does I probably won't be back . Thanks a ton for your help :) __eou__
so i should be able to just use the installation media ( live DVD ) to do it ? __eou__
okay . __eou__
works fine here . __eou__ please don't post youtube url 's here , join #ubuntu-offtopic for that __eou__
Hm , well , nothing /etc/network has a recent modificaiton date . However , dmesg has some interesting bits . **unknown** . __eou__
sorry , desktop install , lvm partition with root and home lv's, nvidia gpu __eou__
Note there the error " Error : Can't have a partition outside the disk !" which means that one of your disks has an entry in the partition table saying that a partition ends past the actual end of the disk . __eou__
is it not under the transfers menu ( just looking online now ) __eou__
http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html __eou__
I agree ... maybe 12.04 fixed it ... hang on ... __eou__ it seems to be working ... but it isn't seeing my phone access point __eou__ not listed in wireless dropdown __eou__
Yes . __eou__
NP __eou__
no luck with any option . I guess I'll burn a full dvd . __eou__
Yes __eou__
now i get you i guess , try ls -l *s . jpg , then rm __eou__ is itat all you want __eou__
**unknown** 2.7 **unknown** . py __eou__ closed by mistaked __eou__
apt-get does that . not sure about synaptic , but it should __eou__
he said the only ppl who use it are hackers so i must be up to no good basically __eou__
they are trying to compete . No-one said they're succeeding ! ( maybe they do ) but anyway . Do you have a tech support question ? if not you can talk about the stupid software center in #ubuntu-offtopic __eou__
With medibuntu stuff ? __eou__
install samba , that is what gives smb __eou__
nah - the next line says chmod 755 /mnt/mxData __eou__
tried saying you have the latest one __eou__ no __eou__ can i mae it same as i use in windows __eou__
It 's possible a number of motherboards would have worked , but like ActionParsnip back up so you don't have to test your luck __eou__
thanks dude , will go check it out right now __eou__ thanks for the advice , but a negative on XFCE __eou__
i want the same in ubuntu __eou__
Ya so true __eou__
and setting it as a daemon ? or startup service ? __eou__
ill try that and see if it helps to clear things up __eou__ yeah but the developers are actually responsive __eou__
all I can see are private IPs , which means non-routable IPs __eou__
when I do an nslookup from my windows machine it says its a non-existent domain __eou__ pfsense is my nameserver __eou__
I dont think you understand my issue . The problem exists on my internal network . Not the interwebs __eou__
haha ... ok thanks . will search for it __eou__ Nice mini . iso , I have made a bootable usb using that iso with the dd command . And it worked ! I am going to play around a little . :-) Thanks a lot . __eou__
| :-) __eou__
I am a fan of lxde or xfce __eou__
thanks mate . I'll have a read up on exact syntax __eou__
what is transmission ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
glxinfo |grep -i render __eou__
I know what this channel is for , but you don't have to be rude to everyone that may or may not know the proper question-asking procedures . __eou__
dont know if the options are still there . havent used the " default " DE/WM setup for a while __eou__
And why is that critical to you then ? The initrd size is determined by all the modules you activated for being compiled . __eou__
No . __eou__ Just use another desktop environment . __eou__
Easy like that :o __eou__
It is __eou__
You're welcome . __eou__
what device name exactly has " increased "? __eou__ that number at the end cannot increase __eou__ sure . if you create a new partition only __eou__
is for local server for the user **unknown** or from my prompt I also use the same **unknown** ... __eou__
MasterOfDisaster : whe the rc . local is executed , there is no environment , and no $PATH set . __eou__ Use /usr/bin/python instead of python . Use the full path . __eou__ correct . __eou__
thanks for the tip :) __eou__
ok thanks for the confirmation that the mbr remains untouched :) __eou__

I can't remember the exact error messages : The first time it ' booted ' to a grub recovery console after an uncertain error message about cannot find drive with uuid awe123uie123 ( or something alike ) and the second time it was just " cannot find drive , please insert drive " - ubuntu installer gave no problems __eou__
i changed it to many .. and i crosschecked it through netstat command also __eou__
ok , so any suggestions where I should ask ? __eou__
the one that contains /boot __eou__
only other thing that you might need to be do ( and should do first if it hasn't been done ) is an fsck , but this should have happened automatically when you booted __eou__
How 's you mean __eou__
For Ubuntu 12.04 LTS __eou__ Both of the commands __eou__
I have , but you still get 1-5 lines of the " last screen page " __eou__
Not sure what the problem is . Seems to work ok for me . __eou__
can you be more specific about what 's going wrong ? __eou__
12.10 __eou__
download the thing , copy it to the bad computer , and do the steps over there . __eou__
Thank you very much . __eou__
OK , I'll ask in an other channel . __eou__
have you investigated klogd ? __eou__
edit how ? __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles might help __eou__
you should use Startup Applications , why don't you want to use it ? __eou__
I would start with /var/log/syslog __eou__
sorry , I'm not getting what the problem is then . __eou__
Why ? __eou__
maybe it got corrupted somewhere along the way ? __eou__
sorry , cant do that , im in kde __eou__
it syncs things down but not up __eou__ and now it works ... lol __eou__
and yes , you have nvidia optimus __eou__ you check in Xorg . 0 . log what is actually used . and you decide how complicated you want the solution to be __eou__
ok , what is ufw ? __eou__ ufw status -> " inactive " __eou__
then run " nslookup google.co.uk " __eou__ what error message does ping google.co.uk give ? __eou__
what portion of system admin are you looking for ? __eou__
nope - Georgia __eou__
Network controller is BCM4321 802.11 b/g/n __eou__
correct , that 's why I asked __eou__ do you normally use a hosts file ? does your interfaces file have dns server entries in it ? __eou__
Yes ... they are different animals . Ubuntu uses the debian packaging **unknown** ) and redhat uses the redhat package manager ( RPM) . This is the fundamental difference which sets the other differences in motion . __eou__
how about ' nslookup google.co.uk ' as wols_ suggested ? __eou__
using unity atm __eou__ when you have a few thousand torrents running , its pretty nessasary to have them grouped __eou__ at least , in my opinion xD __eou__
other than re-installing with kubuntu 12.10 __eou__
maybe preferences or something like that __eou__
i might have to buy it to view the same thing on two different monitors __eou__ but no bluray player involved __eou__
are you booting your computer from a disk/usb or the hard drive ? __eou__
I've placed my machine in DMZ and tried turning off the firewall on the router . __eou__ Also , the ports should be forwarded . __eou__
Cool , you can control the writes to the swap . The general consensus is that a ssd card can take as many writes as a disc type HD now so look for the writing to it control . __eou__
ya that will do __eou__
yes __eou__
well , to start , simple fortran arrays . __eou__
maybe I wasn't clear enough but nvidia-current and nvidia-current-update can't run properly __eou__
thanks __eou__
you think I should learn that one , or some newer , better system ? __eou__
Correct on the primaries , I would see if the HD shows the windows in gparted or a fdisk -l it couls be a number of reasons why you are not seeing it . __eou__
You can do that I believe with the wubi transfer as well . https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi __eou__
that 's a shame __eou__ unfortunately there 's absolutely no way to guess what the problem is __eou__ perhaps if you can describe the problem you're having , someone can help __eou__
How do I boot into single user ? __eou__
yes , everything with sudo __eou__
yes __eou__
thanks . __eou__
I spent six or so hours trying to , got to the point where it turned out the stock video drivers were causing horrible slowdown , and nvidia 's cause the boot crash . I'd keep trying but finals are coming up very soon and I just want the space at this point __eou__
youtube __eou__ I also have sound some apps but no for anything related to music or video ... also dvds play with no sound __eou__ do you think is any misconfiguration on the sound ?? __eou__
Hence your own thread . __eou__ Your issue is only really covered by a few on this channel if you are lucky . __eou__
just all the apps i want to start , so i'll check it and see if it works with process name lol __eou__
sure , give me a sec to do a little test first . __eou__ thanks , I added the source repos and it works fine now . __eou__
if you already selected the drivers , they should automatically build when installing the headers , so you shouldn't have to do anything but reboot __eou__
doesn't say anything about recovery __eou__
I installed that package . __eou__
sorry , thought it was 12.10 kernel . my mistake . forget everything i said . i have no idea . __eou__
ive seen some badly written apps do that . and others dont . i use twinview for my nvudia options . __eou__
do I need to install it ? __eou__
i know the password , i want to change it __eou__
ok lets see if it works __eou__
even with closed ati drivers ? __eou__
Thank you very much ! It printed as expected . __eou__
i cannot boot into recovery on my mac or i can't figure out how to do it is there another way to fix my problem with the nvida driver ? __eou__
you know how when you boot ubuntu from USB , and you can check the install file integrity ? Is there a way to do that without rebooting ? __eou__
I see nothing on the web in linux for this , when you search with password all I see is passwords associated with email accounts . This does not mean it is not possible , but I would not hold your breath for an answer . ;) __eou__
The reason I asked is because I'm not seeing the use of ' dd ' documented at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick . So , I thought Ubuntu Live ISO 's are not designed to be dd'd onto USB ( also , as explained in some answers here : **unknown** **unknown** __eou__
< **unknown** > I would try the latest kernel __eou__ that 's a desktop pc right ? Honestly I wouldn't worry as long as the pc doesnt crash or if you can monitor temps to see . But the problem is probably due to dell custom hardware . Download the latest kernel and try it __eou__
I wanted Netbook remix alone but yeah since it doesn't exist anymore I'll have to go with the desktop layout __eou__
well , how do I get into command line when booting then ? __eou__
I've done a ton of work in PHP . Yes . __eou__
I literally just changed the line that says **unknown** =/ whatever to point to where I put video __eou__
do you know if you're running 64/32 ? __eou__
how do I go abouts doing that ? __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
HD4000 integrated graphics __eou__
im afraid i dont know much about xubuntu __eou__
431 ? udp syslog is 514 ... __eou__
then either ( a ) the cd image has been changed so that it no longer works , or ( b ) you downloaded a bad image/burned a bad image __eou__
it 's bootable , but has MSDOS partitioning . that 's what Gparted was complaining about . __eou__
no , we don't use busybox __eou__ what exactly are you trying to do that 's failing ? __eou__
all I've done is install some nautilis extras like dropbox and **unknown** , and im not using unity I'm using gnome-panel . __eou__
if I were you , what I would do is , locate the zsync link where you downloaded the iso ... then sudo apt-get install zsync then just type zsync http://path/to/iso.zsync this will basically " fix " the iso . It will not tell you it is done till the md5sums match ... and you will only overwrite the corrupt parts of the image . Much faster . __eou__ launch from folder where ubuntu . iso exists . __eou__
What are " watches " ? : S What kind of " limit " ? : S Sorry , I don't understand :( __eou__
thats difficult for helpers - please come again when you have access to your system __eou__
I have been able to access windows from Windows itself , Ubuntu refuses to see it because of Windows not setting up the UEFI partition , something I know how to fix . __eou__
I thought so if you get to doing the md5sum and need to boot from grub makes sure it is you announce the grub legacy for help here . __eou__
nice idea , I will try __eou__
so just the last one is always the destination for all other folders/locations listed ? __eou__
gdm , kdm , xdm __eou__ also known as " display managers " this " greeter " terminology is a new " ubuntu " term __eou__ /proc/cpuinfo __eou__
i would do a half/half of **unknown** . windows doesn't natively support ext4 without third-party drivers ... __eou__ you want to dual-boot on your internal hdd and use the 1tb external for storage , e.t.c ? __eou__
i dont know much about **unknown** , but presumably grub needs to find the lvm modules and perhaps even load a kernel to be able to prompt you for the encryption password . so grub and maybe /boot needs to be outside the lvm partitions __eou__ it takes a potential problem off the table __eou__
sure . just be aware of the 4 partition limit on logicals , and that you will need a partition for ubuntu swap __eou__
I don't understand unix so can u just tell me how to allow it access ? __eou__
umm how would i use memo on the palm __eou__
one of those ? __eou__ i will try to google the words you mentioned __eou__
so you want to delete windows and keep ubuntu ? __eou__
do you have multiple disks ? using RAID ? __eou__ i bet thats the issue __eou__
tried that , nothing __eou__

unity installed without error . thank you so much , i researched this for hours . __eou__
yes __eou__
do you mind telling me , that besides probably fixing my problem what are we achieving with this ? __eou__
oh , the file does exist . I guess the dmenu source is just referencing it wrong or something ? __eou__
i have xbmc serving up via upnp , i watch it on a rooted kindle tablet , i am not sure how it would serve up with other protocol __eou__
looking now . All this makes me wary of red5 . I wonder if i'm going about this the wrong way . Maybe I don't need a streaming server to get JWPlayer to play them . Will try that really quick . __eou__ well , if i don't care about people snatching my videos and downloading them , i don't even need a bloody streaming server . nice __eou__
there is only one user logged in on the ubuntu , and one logged in on the mac ? The issue is that I don't have permission to write on the drive when I move it over to the mac . I just formatted it on Ubuntu , and OSx disk utility isn't letting me ' repair permissions ' ( according to one log I was reading a moment ago , OSx only repairs permissions for the OS mounted drive ) __eou__
so you are good with the 3.5 , booted into it already ? __eou__
I was looking at the installation tutorial he has on it , so would it basically just overwrite ubuntu 12.10 ? __eou__
I need something that doesn't require an internet connection . __eou__
I'd rather a GUI menu based solution , if not I'll fall back to screen as suggested ( googlign shows it lets you do it ) __eou__ thanks __eou__
- I get a command line screen that says that the SysLinux Insane MBR Partition does not recognize the kernel . __eou__

en __eou__ i want to use sox , recording when i say the words __eou__ and if i don't say , it is loops __eou__
I tried that , I have one that does " echo foo > ~/bar " and it doesn't produce a file ~/bar __eou__
should I just switch to awesome/i3/some other tiling wm ? __eou__
I had the same issue , that 's why I restarted it , then I got this problem __eou__
All the pages I could dig up said no . But I'll try the manual as well . __eou__
**unknown** , Analysis and Reporting Technology --- tells you when hard disks are failing mechanically __eou__
Yeah . I saw a netbook version a few years back . __eou__
works ! thank you =) __eou__
im on chrome that might be the prob __eou__
I believe it uses gdm but I'm not sure . The login manager thing looks the same as the stock ubuntu 12.10 one __eou__
... to clean it __eou__
I am not saying that , i just noticed someone is trying to explain to you , how to clean keyboard so I suggested to watch the video on YT . It 's the fastest way to do it . Well , if your computers load is over 1.0 , I bet it can happen your keyboard is lagging . It happened to me few times **unknown** but i am not an expert . Maybe someone can confirm this ? or not ? __eou__
sorry ; surprised it 's that verbose :( __eou__
that sounds like it'd work ... __eou__
well , I guess one could say NCQ is inherited from SCSI ... but yeah , I don't know the details either . __eou__
oh , lol __eou__ is it a picture of Larry Ellison eating a hotdog and suing Linux companies ? __eou__
For ... mail ?? __eou__
thanks , i was aware =) __eou__
or you may reference auth . log for things concerning authentication etc - so as stated it really depends __eou__ simply put there are different " parts " of the system that log in linux or atleast with **unknown** , they are broken into groups __eou__
ahh well thanks a ton I clearly see the partition in parted , ill have to learn how to use that now :-D __eou__
file ? the question doesnt make sense ? __eou__
how do I access that ? __eou__
my desktop system __eou__
how bad is yours ? __eou__
xorg-edgers ppa , install it , what ever the kernel is that shows up is the one that your version will be able to use __eou__
it also shows in top and in the meminfo file ( its just in kb ) __eou__ the command is " free " or " top " __eou__ or you can look in meminfo file ' cat /proc/meminfo ' __eou__
the newer versions of one of the flash codecs doesn't work with a particular type of flash encoding __eou__
what ? __eou__ i did not see any ppa shown , so that is not effecting the upgrade , something else is wrong , not sure what __eou__ there are two apps shown , install them first __eou__ in your first paste , gvfs and plymouth __eou__
it used to __eou__ anyone else here find that getting drunk helps your command line skills go up ? __eou__
yes it will , tell it to setup partitions on your disk . and make / and /home on seperate partitions __eou__ manually that is . __eou__
nevermind __eou__
mine is a gentoo box core 2 quad q6600 with all nvidia chipset and nvidia geforce 250 gts ... but my point is my gaming box is linux . __eou__
I know . There are many many __eou__
do you have a NAT router in front of the mail server ? __eou__ what type of ISP is it a residential plan or a business/enterprise ? __eou__ do a tcptraceroute < your public ip > 25 from outside your house one day __eou__
I'll be sure to look into it . __eou__
try taking a look here http://www.yuki-onna.co.uk/email/smtp.html __eou__
I am only running Dovecot and Postfix , and forwading ( relay agent ) the mail to my ISP 's mail server , why ? becuase i want to use my FQDN 's to send and recieve mail __eou__
thats what i want , i'm currently using the opposite __eou__
i am not sure what your doing but i hear mod_loadbalancer is nice also ( if your proxying to tomcat or some other java container ) __eou__
Not at all ;) __eou__
no grub menu at all __eou__
sarcasm ? __eou__
That will work . __eou__
alrighty then __eou__
ya , but if you provide a access_token in params , than it does not need cookie , and you can get **unknown** . __eou__
yeah we run nginx as a different user __eou__
assume when it is mounted and after you feed it the key . is the whole disk encrypted or just the home folder ? __eou__ consider full disk crypto so everything else is slightly more protected as well __eou__ daves are decrypted when dave logs in . the keys are stored in ram which presumably root has access to __eou__
I do provide the params with ? **unknown** , so it does retrieve back the data with browser .. but not curl __eou__
I am not pro but try from gparted or disk utility or something __eou__ try from Gparted lemme know if it works I am also curious :P __eou__ my knowledge 's last assumption is that your system file manager is out of sync ? __eou__ && hardware problem || permission problem __eou__
huh ? __eou__
apologies , I haven't used thunderbird in years . __eou__
in dconf-editor in **unknown** there are some things to tweak ( carefully ) __eou__ yeah , mine was set to interactive __eou__ after selecting suspend it was warning me about a chromium download in progress , I choose suspend anyway , and it doesn't __eou__
: clap : __eou__
if you have permissions to __eou__
hmmm .... so it works it 's just not showing up on the gui and it 's greyed out in power management __eou__
^ __eou__
Ah . Thanks for your help ^ __eou__ I have one , it 's just not with me and Windows makes me want to crack a baby panda 's **unknown** . __eou__
I didnt even think about it would have shortcut configuration xD __eou__
are you sure this isn't a PATH issue ? PATH is not the same when cron runs scripts . For example are you sure it can find this **unknown** command ? Start putting some debugging statements in your script if you are sure it is being executed __eou__
yes . so it might hang inside the script , as llutz suggested __eou__
Oh , uh . Okay , hit the " Dash home " button at the top **unknown** , then type " Drivers " in , you should be able to find the tool __eou__ Plug the device in first , though __eou__
so see if the fix exists yet in the ubuntu package __eou__
let me see .. :) __eou__
maybe . just wrote a minimal test , and no , it 's not hanging here . __eou__
so this is in fact a problem in mplayer , needs to be reported __eou__
stopping the network manager did the trick __eou__ turned out , your advice is better __eou__
its already done , please go back and read __eou__
Well , fair 's fair , but please try to understand the problem :) Otherwise it just looks like you're trolling . No offense meant . __eou__
I am not sure , you'll have to do some reading __eou__ sorry __eou__
That might work too . I'm not too familiar with virtualization __eou__
ok __eou__
ok , that means it got a link , does eg . host google.com return a few IPs ? __eou__
Sounds good . __eou__
Virtualization software . __eou__
doesnt seem to be working that way __eou__
the idea about . desktop is cool __eou__ worked very well . Now I'm all set to do screencasts . thank you very much __eou__
I wouldn't, no . I've never had that issue __eou__
ok , thanks , then I need to find what packages are guaranteed to exists on which distribution __eou__
were you able to try peppermint OS as suggested ? and lubuntu > __eou__
Its very early days , but I'm playing around with embedded lisp so its a nice platform for me __eou__ yup , certainly is __eou__ its definitely just for dev at the moment , but I'm still having plenty of fun with it . Just wondered if anyone knew much about netusb as I havent really messed with it before __eou__ I'm getting the feeling i may have to do a kernel recompile to enable it though __eou__
i believe so __eou__
you can create a file **unknown** . conf . **unknown** and add entries there I believe . __eou__
thanks , I disabled the HUD in ubuntu tweak . __eou__
1 network card , virtual machine , it 's plugged in :) __eou__
Nah , it depends on your configuration . I'm using **unknown** , personally __eou__
it goes to the **unknown** . conf . **unknown** file which writes the /etc/resolv . conf ... convoluted I know but that 's what the devs decided __eou__
thanks __eou__
then use your client pc package manager to find the proper name __eou__
thanks __eou__
nice one __eou__ I thought cups was always installed by default __eou__
thx __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
make sure any proprietary drivers are enabled in " additional drivers "? __eou__ add the ppdev module to the end of /etc/modules and reboot ? __eou__
generally you have to partition your harddrive first then when you run wubi it will give you the option where to install __eou__
I did chown minecraft : /var/www/multicraft/protected/runtime but same error __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
Compositing , user-friendly configuration __eou__
is this when you wake up the monitor , or do a reboot ? __eou__ Hmmm ... I don't know where those settings are , then . When you log in , does it go to your chosen brightness ? __eou__
I'll check out **unknown** , well , I'm looking for material . I can't go to any of those schools , so . I like the Yale stuff because the tech stuff can get really boring . I like **unknown** theory . __eou__ A lot of the courses seem like only introductory . I want more advanced stuff . __eou__
edit /etc/default/grub , and enable : GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768 __eou__
Can you see them now ? __eou__
rmuser root ssh __eou__
yes __eou__ service ssh restart __eou__ anyways , this is ironic , somone seeking for help is providing help ^ __eou__ He guys . When are you going to release a spice-xpi package ? Compiling this the source of spice-xpi gives me head ache . Someone ? __eou__
np __eou__
becuase my system caches 14gb of my ram , then performance becomes slow as it begins to use space __eou__ thanks , i'll check that out __eou__
Yeah , I heard they will work with Linux too .. The Nvidia also should be fixed ( I loved the Linus video about nvidia ) __eou__
It wasn't before I moved it __eou__ I still don't see it in the var directory , it was never hidden before :( __eou__
in windows , you can install speedfan or hd tune to read the SMART info __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
Thanks theadmin i'll try that . __eou__ it is not showing in the dash . __eou__ I don't understand why I can go through several websites of instructions that say " Additional Drivers " should be in " System Settings " when it is clearly not on any of my Ubuntu installs . __eou__
thanx __eou__
okay , thanks . I'm probably going to give that a shot then since arch looks much more complex for this __eou__
for d in * ; do ls -R $d | wc -l ; done > sizes . txt __eou__ So , they do exist , but I'm no wizard . __eou__
oh ? __eou__
does your command clean a hard disk ? __eou__
its a wireless micro USB adapter on which i cant find any details __eou__ this is the link http://smartlink.co.in/data/products/DIGISOL/MUSTANG%20Series/downloads/DG-WN3150N%20Datasheet.pdf __eou__ can i know how this compatibility works ?? __eou__
what app is not showing ? __eou__
ps auxww | grep cupsd __eou__
I know that rumpe1 __eou__
thanks __eou__
I've done this before . It cleaned the disk __eou__
yea thats what i suspected __eou__
what 's the type of your net connection ? __eou__ how does that work ?? means ? __eou__
it should have an entry already , either for freenode or " ubuntu server " in the network list . __eou__
i've got class in a few minutes , but that looks like the source code for thunderbird 2.0 . Untar the archive and there should be a README with instructions inside for compiling it . __eou__
it should not be set like that by default , i have read , write and execute permissions on my home dir for my user ( ls -al /home ) __eou__ and that should be default __eou__ well its not hard to fix it , just do ' sudo chmod u+rwx /home/username ' __eou__ ah ... you might also want to ask him why he did it in the first place then : 3 __eou__ well , someone with a mind and soul is likely liable for changing home dir permissions . Tell him to check ' cat /var/log/messages | grep COMMAND =/ **unknown** ' __eou__ I'm sorry , not /var/log/message , try /var/log/auth . log __eou__
there is a file you can modify , but I forget it 's location . It 's probably ~/ . **unknown** . list or the other . list file that I don't have on this computer and can't remember the name of __eou__
dropbox isn't really practical then __eou__
I think somebody has also mentioned #ubuntu-arm as possible channel __eou__
then set up the folder in windows to share and you should be able to use the networking with ssh ( sftp ) in nautilus to access the windows folder and place in places in nautilus .. not sure about rsync with windows __eou__
I'm to lazy to switch servers . __eou__
you will have to shrink the extended , to get the free space out of it into ' unalocated ' space , then perhaps move it to get the unlalocated space next to sda1 , then expand sda1 __eou__
thanks for the compile link , just don't understand why they want us to compile versus downloading the . exe __eou__
a linux snob ... does anybody else follow this guys logic ? i just stated to everyone I just installed it today ... how am I pretending be a linux snob ? __eou__
not sure then . you can try stracing the apt-get process for clues __eou__
I only see one on the website . Did you check your hash after downloading ? __eou__
are these plugins ? i don't think i'm running anything __eou__
**unknown** , dr_willis , snoozie , so what is final conclusion in my case , If i have laptop with 8gb ddr3 1600MHZ ram & i am going to install ubuntu 12.10 as a dual boot , should i need to create swat if yes then how much space i should assign 8gb swap or more ? __eou__
it might be wise to learn basic linux with a book or something __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
and the video chipset us ? __eou__ ran the ' additional-drivers ' tool yet ? __eou__
okay but what does the source code compile into ? is it not an . exe ? __eou__
what about running onenote in wine ? __eou__
yep , rebooting now __eou__
im out of ideas . __eou__
not in debain installer __eou__ *debian __eou__
that is generally recommended , but then some people choose not to use a swap when they have that much ram __eou__
i never use hibernate .. so id do 4gb of swap __eou__ assuming hibernate works ... __eou__
I recommend to use at least 2X swap as RAM if you have the space . I use 4X max RAM ( but them again I deal with VMs of actual physical machines) . __eou__
i dont understand the question __eou__
the task he will be performing are noob __eou__
Ahh , the soeren script doesn't do any fancy . Sorry . ikonia just asked how I was running JS :-) __eou__
no idea . got it on steam ages ago . __eou__ each session has a whatever . desktop file . look at ubuntu . desktop for example __eou__
- she must have X-server on both side ... __eou__
UNetbootin -- sudo apt-get install UNetbootin __eou__
but in general its " dh_make -- native " followed by " sudo dpkg-buildpackage " __eou__
I will check the toram , That looks promissing . __eou__
good idea thanks __eou__
what gui ? details please . __eou__ try somthing simple like running ' gksudo gedit ' as a test ? __eou__
How ? __eou__
can't run gui apps from rc . local tried that __eou__
then I should choose the Live instead of NetInstall version __eou__
no __eou__ it 's just a way to interact with ~/ . **unknown** . What are you trying to accomplish exactly ? __eou__
dr_willis , no , it 's fixed in a clean account __eou__
any easy way , to solve the dependencies for that vlc package ? __eou__ I tried with downloading each of this packages and then ran sudo dpkg -i * in the folder containing the packages __eou__
because everything else was firewall off __eou__
sure , Ill be working on it when I get home in an hour , just wondering what i might run into __eou__
That 's nice . __eou__
How do you know if you have a virus on your system ? __eou__
chown -R __eou__
well , the thing is that Totem is a kind of broken player itself __eou__
I think it can be the same . That 's a later discussion . __eou__
Should move the horizontal bar in a very wide firefox webpage for instance . A lot of changes ... various packages . Might be because I am in WindowMaker ... but I think it worked at one point in time after I changed to it . __eou__
Yes . __eou__
found it ;) __eou__
do you know which partitions could be wiped/removed/made into free space ? __eou__
it 's a school connection . intel chipset __eou__
;) __eou__ cd /etc/xdg/autostart ; sudo sed -- in-place ' **unknown** ' * . desktop __eou__ now when you view the items in ' startup items ' you will see them all __eou__ or install rcconf if it is run in the r **unknown** folders etc __eou__
like this ? **unknown** __eou__
also , I can su to **unknown** fine at a character mode root prompt from rescue . __eou__ I eliminated that possibility , while I was **unknown** I did passwd and changed it , so I had the original password ( and my new one ) fine __eou__ I just can't do a graphical log-in __eou__
try apt-get install nvidia-current and reboot .. i guess . ;) __eou__ or apt-get install someotherwindowmanager and select it . ;) __eou__
Looks like there is __eou__ I will ask about it there __eou__
have you fsck'd the partition in live CD ? __eou__ why are you messing with your jounal anyway ? __eou__
I ran apt-get install linux-headers-generic but it said they were already installed . __eou__
this is not the way .. libc-dev has some files in /usr/include __eou__ dpkg -S **unknown** **unknown** __eou__
lols thanks for noticing , ive installed a prefix for it and moved the folder __eou__ only thing im missing now is graphic drivers , which i dont think are supported with my hardware __eou__
thank you __eou__
search the " nvidia-96 " in Software Center and install the one with VDPAU __eou__
after that logout and log back in , should get you back to whatever driver was being used previously __eou__
its just a directory you make , __eou__ use sudo as needed __eou__ and you make a bin direcotry in \root]\ __eou__
hmm .. i'm on 12.04 LTS and it has 1.99 **unknown** 3.4 __eou__
it does detect 10 of the albums __eou__
gnome3/unity isn't exactly going to be blazing fast under a VM ... best of luck . __eou__
I once installed debian and couldn't even get connected , I got no help on forums or in the chat . __eou__
yes i did and no there arent __eou__ seems the FireGL that is in this laptop has been tweaked by HP , and they dont offer linux drivers on their site __eou__
well yes it is possible , I don't know of any elegant ways to use do it , but off the top of my head : use xscreensaver-command to lock xscreensaver and click ' switch user ' __eou__
thanks , I'll try using VMWare with ext2 . __eou__
naaa this is a long process I need to do lots of stuff __eou__
what GPU are you using too ? __eou__ and what is the output of : lsb_release -sc ( one line , so no need to pastebin ) :) __eou__ tried a new ubuntu user , see if its the same __eou__
remove all the packages with ' nvidia ' in the but not ' nvidia-common ' __eou__
no worries __eou__
I guess . __eou__
More detail please . __eou__
ok __eou__
is there a reason for not installing gdm/kdm/lightdm ? __eou__
not for this case , it 's not __eou__
Then I would have to see the screen it showed you . __eou__
oh i know __eou__
mk __eou__
Oh , I have many . __eou__
that wouldn't be smart __eou__
nvidia drivers for a geforce 9300 __eou__
no somsip __eou__ the messages get moved to **unknown** __eou__ when i close to mail client __eou__ i just dont know how to view them __eou__ i did it once before __eou__ but cant figure out how to do it now __eou__
well that 's the " Official documentation " and it 's the first result to come up when searching ubuntu.com __eou__
Not sure , I moved from Washington state back home to Kentucky , packed up my external and when I hooked it up once I got home the file system said " Unknown ". All the SMART data is read properly and says the disc is healthy , just no data . __eou__
that explains it ... is there another utility that 's better equipped for what I want to do ? __eou__
http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/10/install-linux-kernel-363-in-ubuntu.html __eou__
should I not just do sudo rm /etc/init . **unknown** __eou__
cool __eou__ I just realized I posted this q in wrong forum :) __eou__
, correct __eou__
did't get you do you mind some clarification please ? __eou__
the universe repo __eou__ you can find out by searching packages.ubuntu.com for example which will search all official ubuntu repos __eou__ yes __eou__ could you paste the output of " cat /etc/issue " and " cat /etc/apt/sources . list "? __eou__ sudo apt-get update __eou__ sudo apt-get update to update your sources __eou__ it will not install new programs __eou__ its always good to ask to be sure __eou__ so no problem __eou__ with that command your system will read all the package names which are in the repos you have enabled __eou__
" isn't running " __eou__
how about just " xmodmap -e ' keycode 66 = Control_L '" __eou__ assuming 66 is the right one ... __eou__
and because of that apt-get upgrade will NOT update the kernel . . ) for a less confusing explanation have a look at " man apt-get " __eou__
Well there you go . I was always used to installing the openssh-server package directly . :) __eou__
i did not delete any thing , it was the update that made the problem with my wirelesss __eou__
never left __eou__
it 's a intel core i5 , kernel : 3.2 . **unknown** #51-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 26 21:33 : 09 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux __eou__
I has been installed nvidia on my system . Now I cannot find launcher and menu icons __eou__
yeah __eou__
no __eou__ it say only disk read error __eou__
thx , give me a link where to search backport/PPA __eou__
just booting the livecd and doing nothing ? __eou__
I don't know , I have no experience with that ; it 's for a user who insists upon using Ubuntu in an **unknown** environment __eou__
i'm not sure , let me check __eou__ ext4 __eou__
sure , just change the 12.10 to 12.04 in the url :P __eou__ I'd be fairly conservative about the repositories you update automatically though . I would stick to just -security __eou__ here 's the wiki page : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates __eou__
When we use the term mount we are not talking about a manual ( physical ) operation . __eou__
Depends on what you prefer , but I think that 's not a generic support realted question , more like depends on taste :) __eou__ Use Irssi then :) __eou__
hmm atm he 's got it set so he can copy and paste without holding down keys __eou__ it drives me crazy but works for him __eou__
OK ! __eou__ I am using XChat .... any recomendation for a better IRC client ? __eou__ I don't like the GUI ... that 's all __eou__
i get a Could not read /media/ __eou__
You will __eou__
where would there be an EQ then ? ( equalizer ) __eou__
I'm setting up kernel debugging __eou__
cool . i'm using screen with byobu ;-) __eou__
it can __eou__
I did that already and it didn't work . __eou__
isn't that a security problem , so linux is ' forgiving ' with packaged files and accepts every ctime it is given ? an attacker , for example could upload a **unknown** and set the ctime to an arbitrary value , which makes detecting just files very hard __eou__
Oh , not a generic installed system , but liveUSB ... huhh , no idea there __eou__ Anyway , try this : http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-repairrestorereinstall-grub-2-with-a-ubuntu-live-cd/ __eou__
ctrl+alt+number does not do anything __eou__
o.k doesn't look like anything except front mike and line are muted __eou__
Like earlier , before 1.3 I couldn't run Heroes of Might and Magic III with **unknown** through network , now it works great __eou__
That needs imagemagick , Libreoffice is installed as default __eou__
llutz : Thanks you too , I will try it __eou__
big images , since its hand written __eou__
Idon't think RAM is the problem , the computer has 4 GB of RAM __eou__
Which ATI card do you have ? __eou__
I'm wishing I had :( __eou__ Unfortunately , I've never successfully rolled back to a previous version of ubuntu __eou__
with grub1 all was fine __eou__ uuid of hd is correct __eou__
I recommend not using them __eou__
what do you mean __eou__
check in the package manager __eou__ the package is openssh-server __eou__
sorry , didn't get that right ... if i want to enable my server to send mails i need a smtp server . don't i ? __eou__
ok , thank you __eou__
Are you representative of what the IRC channel has become ? Berate people who come in asking for advice ? __eou__
thank u :) __eou__
thanks __eou__ is there a way to actually recreate that list __eou__
how ? I'm totally new to linux here __eou__
yes but also may means kernel problem mounting the filesystems [ i have windows on the same pc , no **unknown** . i was introduced to cdfs which meant to do the job but it 's not for kervel 3 . x anymore __eou__
there a good thread about that , **unknown** __eou__
it freezes at pcmcia_socket **unknown** : cs : IO port probe 0x3000-0x7fff __eou__
found it , " sticky edges " __eou__
well in that case ... lxde is great ! __eou__
if I open sudo gedit < some_file > __eou__
I am trying , no answer there either , but thanks __eou__
i turned off " sticky edges " and now it 's working fine . __eou__
alright , let me try __eou__ alright , suppose if i wanna open Thunderbird __eou__ alright , what command will i type ? __eou__ alright , thanks ! __eou__
you should exclude // __eou__
Yeah , need to let a user/group use sysctl to turn window scaling on and off . __eou__ I can't seem to include the arguments to sysctl in the sudo specification __eou__
just install openssh-server , it'll install the relevant packages . __eou__
no , how can I do that ? __eou__
what if 1000 people say no . ;) __eou__ state the question ....... __eou__
np , seems lp will do that fine __eou__ lpstat lists printers but if one is connected over USB , if i disconnect it , it 's still fine to lpstat . how could i detect if it 's actually connected or not ? __eou__
i use usenet __eou__
Yes . I mispoke when I said that it will adjust the boot partition ( sorry , coffee hasn't kicked in) . I meant to say that it will install it 's own boot loader on the first track of the drive . It has a bootloader that will appear first , requiring a password before anything else . Apart from someone taking the drive out of the machine and running a hack tool ( or having a **unknown** , you're ok . __eou__
if it 's getting permission denied errors , there will be a specific resource it cannot get at __eou__ run it with strace and see where it fails . This will be pretty scary and technical . __eou__ it depends what you're trying to do __eou__ you could try tunneling X over SSH __eou__ in any case , if you're trying to use GUI apps remotely , chances are you're Doing It Wrong __eou__ what *exactly* is the problem you're trying to solve with this ? __eou__
you want only virtualbox ? __eou__
but then you need to do hardware modifications etc __eou__ sorry not hardware mods , but manually reload the OS . __eou__
it just will boot into grub recovery , and only way to get into lubuntu or windows is using the live cd again and repairing the boot __eou__
I shall . Right now , gotta get this working ... __eou__
damn lol , well guess I should be happy then __eou__
http://fpaste.org/PCeZ/ __eou__ ran it with sudo __eou__ not logged into root shell __eou__
after reading that pam config all I can think of is " no dude , your password is wrong " :/ __eou__
doesn't work .. :/ __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
aptitude doesn't support multiarch . see " /msg ubottu aptitude " for details . __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
you should be booting about 1 a month , otherwise let it sleep or hibernate , lappys included __eou__ install ' bootchart ' , figureout what are the time killers , perhaps they can be kept from the boot-up process __eou__ disable ipv6 at the kernel option __eou__
u knw hw 2 do it ? __eou__
yes I know , but here there is no such thing . It happens always after connection : the signal commences strong , and then in two minutes is shown diminished . I hoped it had to do with power saving issues __eou__
i went back to 12.04 . does this exist somewhere ? __eou__
no sir __eou__
How do I find the name of the filesystem ? __eou__
Cool . Nice to know :) __eou__
there has to be stuff i can disable or something thus making it faster to boot __eou__
hmm , does that sound right ? __eou__
Could it help to just update to 12.10 ? I'm just wondering , because I'm thinking about updating ... __eou__
: i've looked for ages __eou__
fair enough , something happened like that with all my compiz stuff recently . __eou__
Okay , now the update manager 's working __eou__ How come the update manager isn't telling me that 12.10 has come out ? __eou__
-bash : . /test1 . py : Permission denied : Nope . __eou__ Oops , nope . __eou__ Oh , yes it is . Dang . __eou__
I think we need some more complicated than that , I will continue looking online ... Thanks ! __eou__
usually scsi devices are named /dev/sdXN ( **unknown** , b , c ,... **unknown** , 2 , 3 ,... ) __eou__ so try look at /proc/partitions after plugging in __eou__ and if it is automounted you may try the mount or the df command __eou__ openwrt ? this is ubuntu support __eou__
look : when you say something every few minutes it is very **unknown** that someone reads the complete statement __eou__
yeah , whats up ? __eou__ I didn't look into that particular page before - it seems not to be suggesting unsupported things - so my warning was not necessary __eou__ no , generally xubuntu is only a different " flavour " of ubuntu , you can install it quite simply - that long customization will also not need a reinstall . I'd suggest to try it in a virtual machine though __eou__
I'll google it for a bit after dinner , brb , __eou__ still there ? __eou__
yeah its working ! __eou__ **unknown** __eou__ just went live ~20 minutes ago __eou__

Nickoleus : thanks anyway ... __eou__
you are root , so no need for sudo __eou__ try : mount -o remount , rw / __eou__ then run it __eou__ then you can either edit /etc/X11/xorg . conf or delete it __eou__ what nvidia GPU do you use ? __eou__ and do you have a switchable GPU ( Intel and Nvidia) ? __eou__ if you run : sudo lshw -C display do you see both chips ? __eou__ have you checked the ubuntu hybrid graphics how to __eou__

I believe so , but I am not expert with those __eou__
Thank you i will try that __eou__
event not found ? __eou__
that I know , the thing is my friend just enabled iptables and wrote some rules in /etc/iptables . firewall . rules , and now every rule I set with ufw does not work __eou__ should I remove the /etc/iptables . firewall . rules file ? __eou__
not sure if thats a option because i dont know it ? i'll try first one anyway __eou__ i get " no protocol specified " and i think i saw " no device matching " or something . also its in a loop of " no protocol specified " with ctrl+c won't stop lol __eou__
what 's the name of the file you saved the output in ? __eou__
debian breaks all their headers and stuff into seperate packages . something to keep in mind whilst building __eou__
it 's a i5 2.5 ghz . Benkinooby : good call , and i guess its compiz as that is using the other remaining bit . ActionParsnip : i'm using the **unknown** driver from ATI and its an ATI 6600 256mb __eou__
no , you could for example give everyone read and then use group permissions to take away read permissions from a certain group __eou__
and the output of : uname -a __eou__
it 's called " tab completion " and it works in the terminal too __eou__
:o __eou__ use dirty word ! __eou__

i will only use kernel packaged form ubuntu , but whats the meta package to upgrade kernel ? __eou__
No , I prefer Super+T . __eou__
I would like to try that second option as well . I will google it as " disable hw decryption module ". I thought about choosing fixed IP instead of dynamic . Can't it be related with that ? __eou__
I used my Celeron 500 laptop until a month ago , lol . __eou__

- sorry > ? im not so clued up on ubuntu __eou__
well try my suggestion because the " if " isn't starting up and the ini **unknown** command I posted above should solve your problem __eou__
yeah , that was the problem . the port was not forwarded =/ __eou__ is there any default iptable rules that you recomend ? __eou__
8800GTS __eou__
ah fair enough __eou__

if you need to restore a windows-MBR you can dd this file into the MBR " dd if =/ **unknown** . bin of =/ dev/sda ", use at your own risk __eou__ sry for confusion , picked the wrong nick __eou__
I understand but the only way into the computer I currently have is through a backtrac live CD __eou__
you are the one that set it when you installed ubuntu __eou__
not that I know of , anyway __eou__
this was a liveCD right ? it has a boot option to verify the disk contents ( i think you hold down shift during the boot or something like that ) __eou__
you're right but he should still be able to have access from sudo __eou__
ewwww why would one do such a horrid thing ... killer use VNC to access ubuntu gui from windows __eou__
I was running off of the LiveCD , since I don't currently have a harddrive __eou__
I don't know how to do that : someone gave me the link on how to do it , but my Mozilla is crashing , which would indicate even more that there 's some read/write issues __eou__
It say 's I need a password . What do I type ? __eou__
doh ... so it is ... __eou__ if it were me personally ... I would edit **unknown** . postrm and remove the reference to a2dissite __eou__

It does __eou__ I gave up on trying to make it work __eou__ So I gave root a password , and elevated with su __eou__ Then ran the command again and it worked __eou__ Then i noticed what was wrong __eou__
my /var/lib/dpkg got broken and I'm nearly finished rebuilding it but I need apt-get to reinstall everything that 's already installed ( thus the ls /usr/share/doc ) to let it know what 's already installed __eou__
Then May i conitnue with the installation then ? __eou__
thanks for the suggestion . unfortunately ddrescue seems to only do whole disks ( too big disk and I only need some of the files) . Also it seems to create img that would still need fixining before one can mount and browse it . __eou__ can you recommend some direct fix ? __eou__
pastebin the command you entered and the error , verbatim __eou__

bash has a utility called " script " that creates a **unknown** that writes to file .

cool . Say you sync from A to B . then you delete something on A and sync again . what happens to the files that were on B from the first sync ? __eou__
Well , maybe you should be asking , by default , what sort of remote access capabilities does Windows XP have ? __eou__ as thats going to define what sort of tools you can use to conenct to it . __eou__
if it 's coming with apt then it will most likely work __eou__ i can assume eventually someone will get the source code and port it to other package managers anyway __eou__

no idea . sorry __eou__
that file had no line " **unknown** " __eou__ i added **unknown** = 127.0 . 0.1 : 9000 to the file , reloaded the daemon but still its not listening .. __eou__ it appears according to the log file I have the wrong syntax for **unknown** __eou__ hrm im not sure what format to use ?

yes __eou__
ok I will try it __eou__ thanks it works __eou__
that worked ! :) Thanks a lot . May i know what was the prob ? __eou__
aha , thanks __eou__
do you mean ureadahead ? that 's not .. __eou__
".. then removing those commented lines should be fine ..." i meant __eou__ so we meant the same thing ;) __eou__
well its alrdy working __eou__
what does ' ls -l link ' tell you about where it thinks the file is ? __eou__
That was a good review . I guess the kids will be happy with it then :-) __eou__
space is very limited __eou__
I see , thanks __eou__
thanks , I'll take a look __eou__
it started after the upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 __eou__
it should not be in a new document , since I have to scan the front pages first and later the back pages __eou__ if I use " New " in SimpleScan I still can't scan . I have to close and restart the program __eou__
Yes . I'm using the md driver . __eou__ The install appeared to go ok for me , but it won't boot . I get just a blank screen with a blinking text cursor . __eou__ Several minutes . __eou__ That web page you gave me starts with , " Ubuntu installer does not come with Software RAID support ." But that seems to be false : RAID was right there in the ( manual ) partitioning menu . __eou__ So what I did was create two partitions on the disk , both set to " use as RAID physical volume " in the installer . One has an ext4 mounted on /boot , the other an LVM with /root and swap in it . ( This is what I did back in the 8.04 days , where that all seemed to work fine . ) __eou__ Oh , hm , it does occur to me that , since I'm not using encryption , I could just do one LVM with root and swap , and not have a separate /boot . Does that seem like a better idea ? __eou__
you can install them all at once __eou__
is there any great resource to start learning iptables __eou__
what processor and ram __eou__
I used sudo rm -Rf foder __eou__
is your problem solve or you want to add something to grub option __eou__
Do they still sell 32-bit HW ? :) __eou__
no , only options are memtest and back to windows __eou__
i can see grub , i can see memtest , but no ubuntu __eou__
same error __eou__ ! paste __eou__
I see ... So I'll get the 64-bit then . :) __eou__
apparently sudo unity reset did the job __eou__
also in the alternate installer ? __eou__
there 's no need for chroot to backup your things . just mount your old installations /home and copy it somewhere __eou__
Can I tell firefox in the config not to create such a . lock file ? __eou__
thanks . ! ics ? I'm happy to set it up in /etc/network/interfaces , but I have to write in the static IP there , and it 's kinda hairy to keep track of that in two places __eou__ thanks , that wasn't what I was trying though . But I found my answer here , which was " disable network-manager ": https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen#Network_Configuration __eou__ a bridge actually makes two ( or more ) separate networks work as a single LAN , by forwarding broadcasts and doing all sorts of stuff . most people don't use it , but it 's great for xen and vpns __eou__
so I'm trying to figure out where ruby installed sass on my box ... make sure that this gives you a list of dirs that looks about right : ruby -e ' puts $ :' __eou__ ok , ruby has installed sass to /var/lib/gems/ 1.9 . **unknown** 3.2 . 2 for me ... __eou__ even though I don't have that in my $ : list . : | __eou__ so presumably some other part of ruby adds that in . __eou__
oh , sorry , I didn't read your paste carefully enough ... those scripts that you source are tailored for specific shells . so , for example , you should source cshrc if you're actually running cshrc . __eou__
How ? __eou__ It just send a normal mail __eou__
can i get it on the store ? __eou__
Thanks will try __eou__
there is such a problem , when i run lightdm on tty1 , it starts on tty7 , i need it to run on tty1 .. __eou__
Eh . In the past , in Ubuntu , Chromium was not maintained or followed well __eou__ I'm asking if the releases will be maintained better in the future , before I switch to it __eou__ Like , for example , Chromium 's version in Quantal is **unknown** . **unknown** .. that 's a whole release behind Chrome . __eou__

how do you make a script executable ? __eou__
But why is Samba not having this problem ? Many clients can easily access the filetree and perform operations without being blocked . __eou__
ok . then follow the bug report i guess __eou__
you might also try enabling codepages in your locale if they are not enabled __eou__
sorry , but i think i found the problem . I installed again ubuntu 11.04 because 12.04 or 12.10 didn't match with my computer . Then i think i did a mistake with the partition , i've got only 8GB instead of 80 ... Thank you ! ( Sorry for my english,i'm french :D ) __eou__
did you try the compatibility of hw through livecd ? __eou__ many people have problem with video card driver vs new xorg __eou__ try 12.04 first __eou__ this an LTS and have lots of support __eou__ ok , I tought that was 12.10 __eou__ try live cd and test hardware __eou__
is every operation using different ports ? I am curious , because I never saw anything like the problem I have when googling . Right now , for example , if I copy anything , all filemanagers , including MC are grayed **unknown** completely . __eou__
alternatively switch temporarily the locale to the same character set as the ZIP file , and then use ' convmv ' to convert the filenames to UTF-8 . __eou__
it is . but there are a bunch of different access points and I need to make a custom connection to select the strongest BSSID since my wireless card jumps around and can't maintain a connection . __eou__
freezes up again , tried to change the boot order , usb-fdd is now first __eou__
also , it is sort of inconsistent to use LightDM and then enabled heavy-duty special effects ... __eou__
how did you test that ? __eou__ yes , but how did you examine the environment from the gui __eou__ ok cool . never knew those were parsed __eou__
ok i will restart X ... maybe that helps . compiz is installed tho . so i have to enabled it then first . __eou__ " compiz -- replace " < -- that maybe helps :) __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
Thank you __eou__
I tried to install ubuntu 12.04 but the install boot menu freezes up , people suggest to try a live-cd , but how can I try this when I still can't access the install boot menu ? __eou__

it just took 5 years to get the extension . __eou__
Not too sure __eou__ Haven't used the thing for a while __eou__
jrib do you have any particular documentation on why this is a singularly bad idea ? ( I'm convinced , but I need to convince the guy who admins the box ) __eou__
can i add that to /etc/rc . local ? __eou__
it was in ubuntu for ever . __eou__
yes , permissions are also part of the issue why we are not using windows in the first place :P windows just ... doesn't handle them __eou__
jrib gdea73 I hope something is possible . __eou__
this is a support channel . if you dont have a question or dont want to help people please go away __eou__
thats owned by billy and in group users so that should work for you . if you " touch **unknown** " what are the permissions on it __eou__ ok .... problem solved ? __eou__ easiest problems to solve __eou__
lsof __eou__
That 's true . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
what you mean with guest-additions ? __eou__
newb ;-) __eou__
if you can see if it has vmx , and whack even 3GB in although 2GB would do , you could run virtualised servers on it __eou__ this makes things more complicated , but it does mean that later on if you want to fiddle about with installing random crap onto a server you just roll yourself a clean instance , and nuke it when you're done __eou__
yeah great news ... __eou__
Both . __eou__
i would ping 192.168 . 0.1 and see if the tx/rx counters in ifconfig are increasing for eth0 __eou__ i would ping 192.168 . 0.1 and see if the tx/rx counters in ifconfig are increasing for eth0 __eou__ or pint -I eth0 192.168 . 0.1 __eou__ actually that -I has to be an address so its 192.168 . **unknown** for you eth0 ? __eou__ yeah ping -I 192.168 . **unknown** 192.168 . 0.1 will go out whatever interface it likes but should come back on eth0 __eou__
unity ? unity 2d ? classic ? or what __eou__
yes ... you need the i386 if you have a 32bit x86 system __eou__ the amd64 is because amd came up with the instruction set modifications that intel then copied __eou__ you are not the first person to be confused by all this __eou__ depends on if you want LVM ... what is your use case and what are you installing onto ? __eou__ then LVM is probably unnecessary . LVM abstracts away the whole partitioning thing so you can easily create and remove partitions and resize partitions without worrying about the physical layout of the partitions . probably not needed for a single disk server like that __eou__
Thanks . __eou__
I am using 12.10 and unity without a lot of custom things installed . But it seems that after about an hour , compiz goes to 40% cpu and never gives it up __eou__ unfortunately , I am unable to form a better question that , what can I do ? or how can I troubleshoot ? __eou__ ( I think I messed up some IRC fu , reposting my question ) I am using 12.10 and unity without a lot of custom things installed . But it seems that after about an hour , compiz goes to 40% cpu and never gives it up . My question is either how do I stop this or how do I troubleshoot ? __eou__
newb ;-) __eou__
that was perfect . Thanks a bunch __eou__
does quit work ? __eou__
I don't see any in the wlist that would add the " -w " option of dhclient3 __eou__
let me try now __eou__ it seems that it doesnt show the requests , but it shows the total or per sec __eou__
the version in the software center is out of date . it 's 7.0 . 1 , not 7.2 __eou__ yeah , apt-get gave me the out of date one . __eou__
thats the kernel module that usually gets loaded , but its not something you would install __eou__ check dmesg to see if the device is recognized and also to see if it detects a card insertion __eou__ yes " dmesg " is a terminal command to read the kernel ring buffer __eou__ you might try " dmesg | grep -C5 mmio " as well as inserting the card and running " dmesg | tail -n 20 " __eou__ rather grep mmc on mine __eou__
correct __eou__
of course not . Ubuntu replaces the " windows boot loader " with a bootloader called grub . Grub allows you to choose which OS to boot . ( windows or linux ) __eou__ Occasionally ( VERY rarely ) the automatically installation / configuration of grub goes wrong and you can't boot either . This is usually fixed using a live CD and installing grub on your own . Again , this is very rare . __eou__
: Ubuntu is by far my most favorite os I am running it alongside Windows 7 but I have not used Windows 7 in about 6 weeks and when I do it is only because I am playing a game on it . __eou__
thanks . __eou__
I realise I only was wondering if I could install the unity iterface in openSUSE or if they are ubuntu only repos ? __eou__
try the ubuntu live cd and see which drives are there __eou__
Well I think Virtual Box is just fine , vmware costs money , and I don't there are major differences . __eou__
zone files ... you got beyond my knowledge there __eou__
I did not EXPLICITLY install t , but i'm pretty sure it 's on here . how do i check/install it if it 's not ? __eou__
it cannot read gpt partition tables __eou__
tyvm __eou__
thanks __eou__
if you disowned vim ... then vim would have no chance of ever getting input ... it would be less than useless __eou__
Don't bother them if you can find it on google but there is #ubuntu-devel __eou__
you could grab a desktop kernel or build your own __eou__
kind of a backwards way to deal with it .. __eou__ Look at **unknown** . __eou__ install ossec __eou__ It will generate emails when somebody attempts to brute force your system . also , theres tools like fail2ban __eou__ I'm actually trying to find documentation on a hardening standard for Ubuntu currently - There doesnt appear to be one . __eou__
Ah I see now . __eou__ thank you escott : thank you __eou__
its called global menubar __eou__
thanks , havn't used ubuntu since 12.04 ( kubuntu ) so I'm not absolutely sure about the commands anymore :) __eou__
http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1121 __eou__ it 's clearly said there __eou__
it has been a persistent problem through reboots over more than a week . __eou__
**unknown** : when it maxes out , what process is doing it ? __eou__ jagosix : let me know when you're up __eou__
in that url , gtkam is the gui for gphonto2 __eou__
wow , i have not this devices before .... intel atom proc was supported in linux .... Try to disable some options in installer __eou__
is it a little sd card __eou__
I don't know of one , maybe there are somethng mentioned on the wiki , or likely #ubuntu-hardened knows __eou__
I'm in Xfce , but it doesn't show up in the equivalent ( Thunar ? ) __eou__
I have that on my server , how to configure it ? __eou__
I believe you need line 7 to be : exec " $PROGRAM " __eou__ I'd ask in #bash __eou__
this is my output : http://pastebin.com/19tHfcdE __eou__
yay ! I just added hardy 's repo to my intrepid install , installed java-sun and the app works like a charm :D __eou__
thanks must have typed command wrong before when I logged out __eou__
vmware , host is ubuntu 12.04 , guest is ubuntu server 12 . xx __eou__
thanks __eou__
autohide works not very well in VMs __eou__ the problem is that the edge of the screen is often done as 0px or 1px at the edge and you move the pointer PAST the edge to trigger the unhide . but you cant do that when the root window is windowed inside something else . consider disabling any pointer integration for better behavior __eou__
there is a variable PATH ( run " echo $PATH " ) which lists paths to search for programs . you type " ls " it search the paths in $PATH to find /usr/bin/ls . which searches $PATH and tells you what would be executed if you typed in ls . updatedb/locate are tools for finding files in general ( not just binaries ) but does not index or search your $HOME __eou__
this is the most recent ... should have backlinks to the older reviews ... which are actually from 2005 , but probably still largely relevant __eou__
every time i attempt to play a flash video it goes in hyper fast speed for the first 4 or so minutes __eou__

I'm afraid I'm still pretty new to linux/ubuntu . What is synclient ? __eou__
do you know where your hardware switch is ? __eou__
Okay , thanks . In that case , do I need a dedicated USB thumb drive or can I keep the files I have on tthere ? __eou__
sent you a pm __eou__
I just did a dist upgrade from 8.04 to 12.04 , and even though the " ip addr show " lists those addresses , I can't ping them __eou__
you'd need an android emulator . You could use the one I just posted for KeviNjLauseN in something like virtualbox , or you could download the android SDK which has an emulator in it . __eou__
hmm ... since when are only default packages/applications supported in here ? __eou__
no , i followed the link , done everything , nothing happens ... __eou__ now can you tell me how to roll back a package it seems i have updated version of vim-common and i need the previous version . __eou__ ok i found the solution that might help others , remove that dependent package -> then install the package you want to -> that will install the proper dependent package :) __eou__
do you have a shell available where you can remount something with noatime ? __eou__
I didn't mean doing SSH in a browser rather if the address is also a webserver that I'd like to access from a browser __eou__ Instead of typing localhost : XXX for a development web box in my browser I could just write " **unknown** " __eou__ make sense ? __eou__
that 's right . that is like it is done on zfs/other platforms . They just snapshot prior install . __eou__
please take that to #windowz __eou__
/usr/local/bin/nmap < --- got this output __eou__
ok thanks __eou__
, thank you __eou__
install gnome-panel , it looks like Classic GNOME2 __eou__
ah .. i was afraid of that .. __eou__ im 100% screwed now .. I was hoping it was the hash so maybe i just made a typo .. but i know the text i typed in and it dosnt work :( __eou__ good thing it was only a fresh install . :P Hello Installation round 2 ! :D __eou__
no __eou__
i'm wondering wt is difference between oracle java and openjdk __eou__
**unknown** : By right-click " rename " is greyed out . Do I need admin rights for that possibly ? __eou__
Sorry , I don't know . Mine says 0 used . __eou__ Sorry then I don't know what can be wrong . This is perhaps not the recommended solution , but in your case I would try renaming my home directory and create a new one . Perhaps it is something in your configuration that renders the **unknown** . __eou__ Look at dr_willis answer . It might be . Xauthority . __eou__
mist of the time i see that here its due to . Xauthority __eou__
what log files in particular , any in /var/log you mean ? __eou__
Loading all of those made no difference . Now I'm really confused __eou__
tried what you suggested . Normal GUI login followed __eou__ ty __eou__
apt-get install hwinfo ? __eou__
thanks for looking into it . I researched it a little myself didn't find much . Ill just live with it for now . __eou__
when I replace quiet splash with text my monitor just turns off . __eou__ Valve requires 3.10 __eou__ i dont mind doing work . If only i can get to the damn terminal __eou__
I dont really mind doing that .. assuming it was a simple affair to get into text onlymode :/ __eou__
there you go then __eou__
I am getting sluggish visual effects . Could that be a driver problem ? I know my questions are vague but trying to figure out why it 's so slow . __eou__
makes sense , thank you __eou__
thnx __eou__
if i remember correctly servers register with rpc bind with the address they are listening and then when a client wants to communicate with the server , it asks rpcbind for its address __eou__ so servers don't have to listen to well know ports __eou__
http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/nvidia __eou__
do you have any idea ? __eou__
No , I have not __eou__
not sure what 's wrong , they show up in devices in my ubuntu file manager __eou__
no , I can't __eou__
#sudo mv -v jre 1.7 . 0 /usr/lib/jvm/ __eou__
Yes , I have installed stuff that makes it freeze and O want to remove it __eou__
yes I typed it like you wrote it __eou__
thank god !!! __eou__
yes .. if you want to edit settings for every user on your system look into /etc/muttrc __eou__ or /etc/Muttrc - not sure which one __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
well follow the directions in the wiki and pastebin more details I suppose . __eou__
thanks for the answer __eou__
i just came here directly after a restart __eou__
no , **unknown** c.d is deprecated ( it 's NOT what ubuntu uses for system management ) __eou__
and displays ' Loading ' for eternity __eou__
some of my peers yes __eou__
you could try rc . local __eou__
It creates a few directories , that 's all __eou__
glad you figured it out . nice . __eou__
12.04 is a special thing . with both server and desktop for 5 years . probably a test-case i'd guess . __eou__
i want to install oracle to my pc where can i get the image file __eou__ oracle database __eou__
commands for cache clearing __eou__
you should probably use a pastebin site to paste your actual error output ... good luck man . __eou__
I'm sorry , I don't understand your question . __eou__
lxde is faster than xubuntu ? __eou__
what does the montior says its native resolution is at __eou__
its worth it imo __eou__
hmm , I forget what version I chose . I changed it this morning from Unity but forget the moniker it had . maybe ' classic ' or something __eou__
try ls / and see if there are any files there __eou__
no problem __eou__ we don't need to know that sort of random comment __eou__
then Server is probably your best bet . if it is older and you want to dedicate it to those services , you would have to do a lot of " leaning out " the desktop version to pare it down to just what you want __eou__
Yeah , I kinda did that but with the GUI program , screenshot to explain : **unknown** __eou__
be **unknown** im NOT ! __eou__
the manpage explains that __eou__
You want gnome 3 shell ? __eou__ Or a gnome 2 look-alike ? __eou__ http://www.filiwiese.com/installing-gnome-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/ __eou__
btw , you're using an obsolete , unsupported version of ubuntu , an upgrade is recommended __eou__
Thank you it 's very appreciated __eou__
apt-get install __eou__
well , thank , am downloading it __eou__
Where you wrote " none " is where you put the mountpoint , which must already exist . So you would make the directory under /media like /media/user first then /media/user/MyBook and then put that instead of where you put " none " in the fstab line __eou__ Apologies on lag , work is requiring my attention quite a bit __eou__
Yep , unless you want to install lotsa software __eou__ ! swap __eou__
I'm assuming I'd have to ' join ' those chunks then decompress it to get an . img .. The chunks are 2GB __eou__
As you could see , I have only one of them installed now . So what is the problem from apt 's point of view ? __eou__
via unetbootin ? __eou__
I'll help you , wait till I search online . __eou__
how do i stop a chroot ? __eou__
This is what I call a good flash game : http://www.kongregate.com/games/aardman/home-sheep-home-2-lost-underground __eou__
thelinux When do you think they will be considered more or less stable ? I don't think NVidia would release something that doesn't work at all __eou__
You dont want to upgrade to 12.10 if you're using Unity __eou__
I was hoping that I would find someone who knows if it mess up your system first __eou__
I'm guy too , I was joking . __eou__ What emulators you use ? __eou__
I'll try thanks __eou__ neither worked __eou__
I was just reading where Linus trashed nVidia . Kind of makes it harder for me to sort out which is optimal . __eou__
domedagen : thanks , what 's the default wm for 12.10 then instead of unity ? would it install by default during upgrade or did you warn because there are issues with auto update ? __eou__
Well , ATI is generally more open than Nvidia to start with . Hence why we have much better open source drivers for ATI than Nvidia . On the other hand Nvidia 's proprietary drivers are supposedly better than the ATI open source ones , but this difference has been less and less , and it not true in my personal experience ( though it probably is generally) . Also I'm a bit of a **unknown** , and with the rest of my hardware being ATI/AMD , it __eou__
on any flash video , set it to full screen , right clic , properties , disable hardware acceleration __eou__
I don't know offhand , I use the 64bit one . i would think so however __eou__
you mean 12.10 is not LTS ? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS __eou__ oops ... typed too slow __eou__
thanks for the information . FWIW , I believe Ubuntu should provide transparency in this whole Amazon thing . It smells kinda fishy . __eou__
Well ... Share my files ? Let people put cool stuff on it ? Lol __eou__
anyway , I don't use unity , but my understanding is that many improvements were made in 12.04 ( and presumably in 12.10 as well ) __eou__ if I were in your shoes , I'd go to 12.04 . It 's LTS and , like I said , I seem to recall people claiming many improvements to unity __eou__
you can use the . inf file to install a windows driver , Id try to use a linux driver first though __eou__ did you try installing drivers for your computer with ' additional drivers ' panel ? you may need a wired conenction for it to get updated drivers . __eou__
: thanks __eou__
I really don't give a shit to be honest with you __eou__
When who doesn't want to be helped ? __eou__
you dotn use unity without X as X is the backend for all GUI displays in linux __eou__ what the heck is " vidalia " never heardof that application . __eou__ someone metioned a while back echo $DISPLAY __eou__
mail to **unknown** **unknown** works too :) __eou__
Stop with your input __eou__
are you sure your X server is running on 0.0 ? __eou__ and not 1.0 or 0.1 or sometihng ? __eou__
well , mine works great too .. but i noticed the battery isnt as long-lived as when running osx .. + VLC sometimes spikes when i watch movies __eou__
i use irssi for tty , irssi doesnt have ssl though __eou__
thanks for the help , didn't realize Unity 2d wasn't installed by default with 12.10 __eou__
google enable some ppa __eou__
it doesn't __eou__
nope I don't trust anyone , plus I've had issues with google before losing files __eou__
iv only updated via web ... today I was at the university , where the internet is REALLY good , so iv gave a shot to update from 10.10 to the latest rts __eou__ didnt used much , was goint to start working now __eou__ ill give a shot . but i have no no " desktop " folder inside my /home , not even with a different language as told in some posts __eou__ yes __eou__ took 3 hours __eou__ no __eou__ my user didnt even asked for password on login __eou__
yeah ... __eou__
absolutely __eou__
Thanks I'll check it out . __eou__
Oh . I can help you with that . Press dash home in the top left corner then type Terminal , after that eiher click it or drag it to your side bar . You can also type C-M t __eou__
have you used it before ? did it work well and not mess up your drive or local storage ? __eou__
http://pastebin.com/dt20Xpva __eou__
That is what I was trying to determine before -- hence the question " what happened ?" usually you don't have grub issues unless some destructive event occurs , i.e. file or disk corruption __eou__
did you move its start ? then you need to reinstall grub __eou__
yes , that worked fine from within nautilus , providing the workgroup , username and pw __eou__
: thanks buddy :) __eou__
So I guess thats a no . __eou__
Is it tiny ? __eou__ I mean , physically __eou__
Yeah . It was working fine __eou__ I am thinking that my hardrive failed and it is trying to boot from network but I am not sure __eou__
I booted before without any boot parameteres __eou__
nothing would guarantee the process PID is 1234 __eou__
exactly . __eou__
I do : **unknown** __eou__ does that help ? __eou__
using the test button . __eou__
in previous versions of Ubuntu , I did not need to add my username/pw to fstab __eou__
ok __eou__
indeed __eou__
?? __eou__
i dont think so :) __eou__
Thank you , I wasn't sure if that was what #ubuntu-devel was for . __eou__
thanks __eou__
there also should be a checkbox under hardware drivers that allows you to select the nvidia package aswell . make sure you have this checked __eou__
if you are running 12.04 you can click on the unity button or hit the windows button then go to applications it will be under hardware drivers __eou__ it runs by itself . __eou__ blackness is right the apt-get command will work . __eou__ If you are done with installing grub give it a shot you should be good , then hop back on and let me know if I helped . __eou__
again the best results I got were from 304.43 __eou__ good luck :-) __eou__
yes , but after everything i thought i'd try it __eou__
I cannot remember . I just want one that works correctly ... __eou__
It will leave the current install alone provided that you follow the instructions . __eou__
For the record , no other distros have given me hell with my nvidia card ... __eou__
indeed ! :-D __eou__ Sure . - I just like Linux being that straight forward ! __eou__
It might be in the flash setting . I am downloading flash player for chrome give me a few minutes and I will see if I can help . __eou__ I ran a video on youtube with chrome and it played fine for me . __eou__ When I lloked into the flashplayer settings there was no option to adjust the playback speed . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__
i believe i have it set right . it was labelled as you described - 1 = center __eou__ is there a shell command i can use to print settings ? __eou__
Sometimes the audio will keep going and the video stops working . __eou__
And I see that I /do/ have a passphrase , because when I run gpg -- armor -- **unknown** -- decrypt file . asc , it asks for my passphrase ... __eou__
I was saying that at the end of the tutorial they precise that the notofication icon doesn t appear all the time but that there is a way to solve this __eou__
i followed this tutorial : **unknown** __eou__ i got it working one time then the notification icon **unknown** __eou__
I think so :) __eou__
don't know anything that can do that but if you need to input literal do " 0x1b " or ^V , ESC __eou__
definitely 64bit __eou__
i checked it out earlier , and it 's not listed .. but i guess it wont hurt to try . the machine should be here shortly ... __eou__
thank you __eou__
Cool I was trying to decide whether or not to install it on my other laptop . __eou__
where does it give me that option ? __eou__
is a win machine ever going to need to read the ssd ? __eou__
that guy hasn't updated the stable channel either :( his dev channel is current though . guess I'll use that for now __eou__
good ideas ... thanks buddy __eou__
:( __eou__
just 12.10 , 12.04 was the LTS __eou__
ok tnx ill try __eou__
ok so is there a way to give permissions to user " **unknown** " as root to view network folders somehow ? __eou__
there is also imo . im which is web based and has this kind of walkie-talkie feature ( which I have not used , so your milage may vary ) __eou__
So which command we use for . gz file .... as for . tar . gz we use tar xvf filename __eou__
no point complaining here , we just do support , we don't design ubuntu __eou__
sudo rm -r /usr/lib/jvm __eou__
nope __eou__
not aware of a flag for that , __eou__
when the CD " image " was made the link was there , if you want to alter that you'll have to re-build the whole image ( it 's in squash fs ) __eou__
what 's the " for " for ... what are you trying to do ? __eou__ oh right , I was testing in zsh . Never mind then . __eou__
correct __eou__
exactly ... but network manager can only do one at a time , whereas terminal can do both . __eou__
killall just shows the option and switches __eou__ see the killall snip http://paste.ubuntu.com/1347726/ __eou__
i just use java -- version to see what java i have __eou__
I can't get it to boot because the graphics aren't working properly . is there a keyboard shortcut I can use to edit it without booting ? __eou__
not that name , maybe unity-lens-shopping __eou__
it stopped working after i upgraded to 12.04 . Now my wlan0 is reconized as eth1 and i can't authenticate __eou__
You're welcome :D __eou__
I always do fresh intsall __eou__
ok :) ... well then tell me why the output of sar does not correspond to the output of htop(regardin CPU usage ) __eou__
defekt : thank you for the help I appreciate it __eou__
it 's an easy mistake to make . Don't do it with " shutdown -t now " __eou__ you didn't __eou__ you're a welly , aren't you ? __eou__ now start listening , we know what we're doing __eou__ different version though __eou__
It works but as soon as I reboot it enables it again __eou__
grep was cool __eou__
ssh can be bruteforced , just make sure you use a " secure " password __eou__
ye i know about sar , but it also returns this weird avg% which is not the real time copu utilization __eou__ its the same as mpstat ... it keeps showin 90% idle while all cpus r utilized 100% __eou__
i know , but i wanted too __eou__
they are both build on the same libraries , so the core difference is unity/gnome-shell the rest should be the same __eou__
right __eou__
if you run : xev and press the key , does it make an event ? __eou__
I mean vncviewer doesn't ask for password , it just prints this error . I can read it in the vnc log also . But I can ssh into the server : can I reset vncserver to ask the client for password ? __eou__
yeah , works ok here in raring __eou__
Thats switch from 12 **unknown** to 7 **unknown** was most likely caused by NTP . __eou__
will look it up __eou__
yes , but on another channel here __eou__
the NTFS one is fine . The ext4 one isn't. I'll just chown it __eou__
is an address assigned ? __eou__
maybe , whatever , I don't need the 0.3 GiB anyways . Was just wondering . Thanks :) __eou__
no idea , check if it 's a valid option __eou__
it 's a preference thing . new in 12.10 is shopping __eou__
do your own homework __eou__ try the " alis " bot __eou__
lol , okay , thanks __eou__
Not even a workaround really - just install it and right-click it on the launcher . A lot of us installed it in anticipation of getting beta invites ... then didn't. :p C'est la vie . __eou__
the deb doesn't work . I just installed it now __eou__
it 's nothing to do with ubuntu __eou__
like a charm __eou__
how can I do that ? __eou__
so - if one can use the login command - how is it , that the error message hikenboot sees is server related ? __eou__
before the virtual user was part of the problem , but unless its still using it but not letting me set it I don't think it is anymore __eou__
you're right , Oracle doesn't officialy support ubuntu , but you can use the instructions as a " base " and just adapt __eou__
helpful - thanks __eou__
Thanks __eou__
can't see the video as it 's flash , but I still disagree __eou__ once the kernel boots , it 's smp aware __eou__ can you summerise what you believe you need to change ( as I can't see the video ) __eou__ no , it 's not __eou__ that is a long and old approach to system V init __eou__ ubuntu doesn't use system V init any more __eou__ no need to apologise __eou__ you can't trust the internet , anyone can write a web page __eou__ nothing __eou__ I'd advise you to leave it alone __eou__ it 's just smp managing it __eou__ don't worry about it , it 's being efficient __eou__
a bug is " something is not working as it should " __eou__
what is you skill level yet ? __eou__
priceless __eou__
thats what I tried but it doesnt exec bashrc or anything __eou__
I know that if I want to also program 64bit apps it might make a difference correct ? __eou__
right , so that is the problem __eou__ you're running in a chroot , and it can't execute __eou__
see what lix asked you earlier __eou__
Ok , thanks __eou__

to be honest i don't think it is a driver problem . i think that i can not access the hardware switch - but let me look up the info for you __eou__ lspic says Network controller : Ralink corp . RT2500 Wireless 802.11 bg ( rev 01 ) __eou__
i am on 12.04 ( LXDE ) __eou__
can you design a statement that will work ? __eou__
because i love the old ubuntu __eou__

are you talking about my graphics problem ? __eou__
smd ? __eou__
no . if you typed in pwd it would show up as pwd __eou__ aliases are interpreted after you press ENTER __eou__
fair enough .... the bash man page has a very good explanation of aliases , and when/why they are applicable __eou__
try xubuntu or lubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 , __eou__ i'm pretty sure that if oyu install 12.04 or 12.10 , your wireless card will work right away . __eou__
orang indonesia toh __eou__
ok , so check that for each of your shells , it will tell you where they are being stored __eou__
yeah but the others are kept somewhere else since they turn up sometimes when later logging into a new shell __eou__
no __eou__
Thanks , will do . __eou__
dolphin , even if i was that crazy to be willing to force **unknown** , is there a file i can store that string ? I can always restore the previous values ... __eou__
< **unknown** > eamon : why are you asking here ? __eou__
its one of the main reasons im not upgrading to ICS __eou__ if you assume that there isn't any point in securing anything __eou__
dmesg shows last boot 's record , right ? __eou__
Thanks . I'll check out the ' dd ' command __eou__
i dont have enough space to back all that up __eou__
there will be system files __eou__
the * . so contains entry points and symbols ( you can view them by running " nm **unknown** . so " but to compile a program that will link against those libraries you need the header files which contain all the function prototypes and declarations specific to the language you are coding in __eou__ you get all that when you build the thing by hand but you dont have to do that with ubuntu . the split the make install part that installs the library and the make install-headers part that installs the prototypes into different packages __eou__
A budy is having issues with sound . Im trying to troubleshoot with my limited knowledge of Ubuntu __eou__
then stop arguing about PHP ! __eou__
which is reasonable ... but if thats ones feeling then why ask for an alternative ... __eou__
its for a general storage and backup drive , i am the only user __eou__ ^ __eou__
I'm not being negative , I'm being real , if you can't copy and paste a line , then running a vm is out of scope __eou__
I never said it wasnt better . I was just giving advice lol __eou__ I didn't know it was ssh __eou__
what problem are you trying to solve by changing that setting ? __eou__
If you're working in IT , that 's always a plus ! __eou__
jockey was removed in 12.10 its not part of software sources __eou__ so start " software sources " and the last tab is " additional drivers " __eou__
couldn't find it on xubuntu __eou__
go to the link you gave me and try and download the 32 bit version . __eou__
no at startup when starting computer so it less boring __eou__ i want it to play eatch different song from my musics folders every time __eou__
Maybe . __eou__
Jordan_U had a good point , you want jockey-gtk :) __eou__

Yes I use that but the error is it couldn't locate the package and I am seeing it from ls that it is exited __eou__
it is listed under ps -e __eou__ even I know better __eou__
oh i see __eou__
Please connect the phone in USBMS mode and pastebin the output of " sudo blkid ". __eou__ Are you booted into Ubuntu currently ? __eou__
" dpkg -S /usr/lib/jvm/ " will list all installed packages with files in /usr/lib/jvm/ . __eou__
thanks =D __eou__
ok , thx __eou__ so here is no any options to get it double sized or triple for example ? __eou__
no idea , I hate cmake :) __eou__ does ' sudo service jack restart ' help ? __eou__
have you tried killall -9 banshee __eou__ try mv ~/ . **unknown** ~/backup-banshee __eou__
I will reboot in a bit __eou__

you'd be surprised __eou__
if you spend quite a bit of time using the Terminal , you might like bash-ido as well . :) __eou__ it completes file paths using the emacs-style " **unknown** ". way faster than using just bash-completion . __eou__
nvidia-current __eou__ yep . doing that at the moment . :) __eou__
thats not greats __eou__ i have successfully switched my debian to other distro ... __eou__ i think you're right .. ubuntu was made a big changes/hooks to the apt/standard packages core ... __eou__ actionparsnip , i think it was greats if you can switch ubuntu to other debian based distros easily ... __eou__
whats the command , do you know ? __eou__
plus , the vim Vundle package manager I use clones Vim plugins from github using git . so that kinda helps set up both vim and emacs on all my machines within seconds for example . __eou__ http://github.com/gorakhargosh/dotfiles.git < -- vim and general bash configuration . __eou__ http://github.com/gorakhargosh/gemacs.git < -- emacs configuration . pretty simple really . :) __eou__
just want to know if apt was greats :) __eou__
Now we have found out that it is not a drivers problem , but a windows dualboot problem , shall i remove Wicd __eou__

Startup programs , wallpaper , repositories , docked icons , etc . __eou__ Even terminal changed the profile colors . __eou__
looking for the logs for #ubuntu-ir :-/ __eou__
whats more strange is that even the onscreen keyboard does not work , and even stranger in the sidebar i can open programs wich are shown there , but not the " Dash Home " __eou__ " **unknown** : then you'll need to try a different module . Are there any bugs reported ?" i dont think so __eou__
did that __eou__
espeak does that too __eou__ or try festival __eou__
perfect , exactly what i needed __eou__
thought so , thanks __eou__
try them all __eou__

ActionParsnip : typo on my part - realised . thanks :) __eou__
is there a better way to mount a share and still have read and write permissions and use NFS with it ? __eou__
thanks , just noticed that myself :P __eou__ should I try to mimmick the commands listed at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookAir4-2#Wireless ? __eou__ Seems like I should be able to execute all of them except ' sudo apt-get update ' __eou__
don't know . I keep b43 driver files which I would if anything happened ( one day ) to the current one in /lib/firmware and that 's how I install it . __eou__
that was totally unreadable to me __eou__
when I start from terminal , it merely says " Segmentation fault ( core dumped ) " __eou__
then use the inf-file with ndiswrapper to install the windows drivers __eou__
create a new user __eou__
i'm on ubuntu 12.10 , and i've installed the driver but i can't get it working __eou__
you can only su to root if you've set a root password . One isn't set by default . It 's also not necessary and not recommended __eou__
I have . gnome2 is dead __eou__
everything seems to be working , I just don't want to have stuff that I don't need on the system , since I only have 30gb , and I don't know which of those are needed for unity . __eou__

this is a support channel , not a discussion channel __eou__
thx __eou__
thank you . __eou__
i've actually asked about why the hostname was required - i was told to check the man page ;) sure enough , it 's documented . IMO it 's a huge pain , ' cause you can't just transfer the file to new installs , must rename with box 's hostname attached to the file :( __eou__ see jrib 's comment above . i don't seem to use . Xresources ( ie . not one on my install right now , so can't confirm ) __eou__
ok well you can just delete ~/ . xsession-errors if there 's nothing obviously wrong __eou__
i would try reencoding with a diffeerent app , and try a different riper tool . __eou__
am sorry but its very funny __eou__ to joke __eou__
Excuse us , with you mint talk about ubuntu __eou__
not on my ubuntu 12.10 64bit install , I know I can move /tmp and /var/log to memory , but I also see /var/run being used by some apps a little too much __eou__
**unknown** : I see . - let me check __eou__ you just want to mount the tab , not installing ubuntu on it , right ? __eou__
but I get the per user thing __eou__ do anyone know how can I purge chinese locale ? __eou__
It isn't old , it 's constantly updating with a wide and large community . __eou__ Which version of ubuntu you have ? __eou__ You can use unetbootin as alternative . __eou__
i dont have permission to edit the sources . list __eou__
zykotick9 thelinux thanks ! __eou__
hmm ok __eou__
sorry i understand now i thought you were saying that by doing so it would not upgrade lol __eou__
what about if i use it to work in the university , as a student , lts ? __eou__
no ... i meant to say ... as we use vi ... in vi editor ... is same in vim __eou__
No bigger security risk than FTP . __eou__
right above , didn't hilight you sry . __eou__
I can't, since it has not checked : nothing to uncheck ( it is a known bug ) __eou__ only English and Hungarian are checked , therefore I cannot remove one from chinese 's __eou__
theres ways to have sftp only users i belive . __eou__
Has your disk died on 12.10 ? __eou__ Hmm . __eou__ Better turn off your computer then ... __eou__ Find out what 's causing that activity and please don't spread FUD about something you don't know what you're talking about . __eou__ 20Mbps is not normal behaviour , on an SSD or HDD . __eou__ Does it regularly happen ? __eou__
can i use quantal ppa ? if not , i might as well just compile from source ... __eou__
And ...? __eou__ You have bad sectors . Replace that drive . __eou__ You can , but you should not ... you have chances to frag your filesystem entirely . __eou__
please concern yourself with your own behaviour __eou__
i'm doing that right now __eou__
no __eou__ cpu utilizaion ???? where did that come from , you said hard disk writes a minute ago __eou__
do you understand italian ? __eou__
dpkg -l says yes __eou__ Is my user supposed to be in the " sound " group ? __eou__
what is the output of : wget -O alsa-info . sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x . **unknown** . sh && . **unknown** . sh -- upload __eou__
you can simply run dpkg-reconfigure gdm to be given a choice of what desktop manager to use __eou__
here again , you can run dpkg-reconfigure gdm __eou__
so it can recognise fedora .... __eou__
Haha , my bad . Sent that to the wrong user __eou__
jCuber I don't want speak italian __eou__
windows XP is performing poorly on this laptop , thats why i want to move to linux .... idleone jcuber mattsyco __eou__
wyclif , Yes , my bad , get Lubuntu __eou__ wyclif , Lubuntu is just a lightweight Ubuntu . __eou__ tbh , I've only used Ubuntu versions up to 10.04 , so I'm guessing Ubuntu 12.10 would be the one . However , I'm not sure about your system specs . __eou__ Do you know your laptop model ? __eou__ Ahh , I see . Maybe you should try formatting your hard-drive and re-installing Windows XP if you've installed too many programs . __eou__ I think that 's the best option . __eou__
ThinkPad T530 with Intel HD4000 on **unknown** , and Nvidia NVS 5400M __eou__ I don't run the system without A/C very often , but when I do , battery life without any Nvidia-accelerated apps running is quite good ; around 7-8 hours on minimum screen brightness __eou__ of course , if you are doing 3d gaming on the nvidia GPU , expect battery life to halve or worse __eou__ hence the whole point of optimus __eou__
if i write a 30 byte file to my HDD it doesnt just write it , it waits several minutes __eou__
i thought of that but ive looked at one of the foryums and it had an rss feed for a sub forum(not the whole lot ) so would i have to add one for every sub forum if you get me ? ive got that **unknown** ? __eou__
lubuntu is the light version afaik ? __eou__
yeah , if I do startx it tries to start into kdm __eou__
my students chats over the thin clients :) __eou__ they can't install software so was wondering which builtin software are using :) __eou__ lol __eou__
which url ? __eou__ very useful link __eou__
Fair enough , thanks mate . __eou__
ty __eou__
well now it 's got one fat32 partition taking up most of the drive , and 2.49 mb partition taking up some other space that I couldn't write over . __eou__
it won't show in disk utility __eou__
bleh , it used to work with a cd-r :( __eou__
for what ? i don't even use Ubuntu __eou__
Doesn't look like that worked :( __eou__
if you want __eou__
Ah , cool , thanks __eou__
Check and verify that the partitions actually became like you wanted . __eou__ 30gb available ? That 's not what you want . I don't know what you mean . __eou__
I have it already ... proof : pastebin.com/qjM8JdUh __eou__
thanks i knew it was similar to df __eou__
sure __eou__
oh , I see power maanger not brightness settings __eou__ thanks . __eou__
/home ( ext4) , I have a / on a separate partition , also ext4 __eou__
NFS/Samba/SSHFS __eou__
Could you please pastebin the entire command and its output ? __eou__
Can u give me example ? I dont have much experience with scripting __eou__ Maybe I should ask that to bash as well ? __eou__
nothing when you have the money , currently to buy a new drive , also it 's in the netbook :) __eou__ this happened after I reduced the home partition by 1Gb , using gparted __eou__
It probably has something to do with loading drivers/whatnot in parallel ( it usually works , but in some cases ... ) __eou__
check this website https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/370590:connect-evolution-to-an-exchange-server __eou__
well you can just give them a different default . bashrc but in the end a prompt is a very personal thing :P __eou__
Bummer __eou__ Okay I'll try change my habits __eou__ But aptitude was so nice :( __eou__
ok __eou__
ok Ill make another one ...... thank you for helping we tried __eou__
I've always ran 64 bit desktops and never seemed to have a problem , but I've never ran Ubuntu before . __eou__
not nice __eou__
I'm using wine . The problem is not about *running* , but *log in* __eou__ I'm using it without problems on my Arch machine ( not that I think it 's some problem with the distro , since I ran it pretty well until two weeks ago , when I installed the most recent wine ) __eou__
so my home server and samba shares that are all working on my arch laptop and my wife 's windows 7 and my debian box and then ubuntu is the only fail __eou__ thanks trying __eou__ yup it is in modeprobe __eou__
well you do get a new kernel , and that kernel will have various differences . you might try selecting and booting your old kernel and see how that works __eou__
thanks . __eou__
no __eou__ set it to UTF-8 ( not the hybrid :) ) __eou__
should I unmount and reboot , at this point ? __eou__
Yeah I remember when it did exist , it was basically just a list of all the groups and you ticked checkboxes . __eou__
as in which file is run from $PATH , it 's ok , that was correct __eou__
thanks yeah nothing there ... __eou__
yeap , a point and kill game for ubuntu , in gksu mode __eou__ believe so , but you have to serve up the other display , x11vnc something does it __eou__
" Seeing ZOOM " __eou__
unless of course that is the same bug you are seeing , then you don't need to file a new one __eou__
I shouldn't have to though __eou__
microsoft terminal service __eou__ have you tried terminal service ? __eou__
ok __eou__ you think so ? __eou__
reboot __eou__ unless you know a way to get the kernel to use the headers __eou__ listen to escott __eou__ the issue is the driver , si ? __eou__ :) __eou__ seems there is a ubuntu channel for android , #ubuntu-arm __eou__
you may need to disable apparmor for named or update the apparmor profile __eou__
may i ask why you use ' **unknown** __eou__
any ubuntu 64 bit user from version 11.10 __eou__
I couldn't find the dkms command so a reboot was easier __eou__ correct , it works now __eou__ it isn't an out of tree module __eou__
awesome trying that now __eou__
Thanks __eou__
Thanks , does it have its own **unknown** ? __eou__
i think that is embedded in the kernel . __eou__ if you change the /etc/lsb-release , logically any repository cannot find your custom build __eou__
i edited this file , All things is true but " apt-add-repository " not work ! __eou__
yeah man i got it . thanks for the help though . __eou__
thanks a lot sir __eou__
because that 's the only available download for a newer version . Off of " getfirefox.com " they only offer a tarball download . I would use the software center for a newer version , but I'm on ubu 8.04 . __eou__
I am not entirely sure , but I will deffinately check it and I thank you for your support :) __eou__
hm ? echo " hello world "; echo ; echo " hey " __eou__
added a mode , and then arandr didn't like it , so I needed to either delete it or change it . I got it removed now , so I'm good now :) __eou__
you mean what is my yahoo id ? __eou__
where should i put that ? __eou__ oh , i want to be able to close my terminal also __eou__
great , but is 11.10 lts ? wait , i shall get busy loking it up myself __eou__
" It is possible to get , install and run network connect completely without Java " and for the keys , in " ~/ . **unknown** " __eou__ That doesn't solve your dynamic IP issue though . Just thought you'd like to know you can avoid the web-browser java plug-in authentication __eou__ A possible solution would be to get yourself a ( free ) micro AWS EC2 host instance , configure it as a proxy , and use it to relay your connections . Although if it gets stopped/started it could also change its IP . You can get static IPs in some of the paid-for services . __eou__
done __eou__ done* __eou__
right , thanks . Do you have a client for linux ? __eou__ maybe java based ? __eou__
disk manager here on windows ? __eou__
I'm on xubuntu __eou__
For the latest features , __eou__
there are a few similar ones ... **unknown** is my choice __eou__
randomly . It cause some iptables rules deleted .... __eou__
gimp does screenshots ? __eou__
Then , as ActionParsnip said , the defaults are basically fine *but* you should consider setting a restricted shell for that user that only allows use of the svn tools __eou__
Okay , thank you invariantr **unknown** the joke is on me . __eou__ I have forgotten to make it executable . __eou__
why ? I have the latest stable kernel for 12.04 __eou__
I have tried that , but I cannot make sense of the output .... __eou__ I cannot identify the problem .... 2m at startup + overuse of the disk ar equite limiting __eou__
it won't detect my optical drive __eou__
just collecting intelligence , cause on my main machine the switch from 10.04 to 12.04 didn't work smoothly . I would like to use the newest lts on laptop __eou__
haha , i do ! __eou__ it 's right next to me __eou__
ok . Then you want to use chown -R __eou__
I mean that I change all my repositories from an LTS release to a regular release , and then update my system __eou__
but what about the hd 6310 ? __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
i said nice __eou__
@cookie awesome , i wanted to be sure before i screwed up the server and lost 8tb of crap lol __eou__ thanks again , that got it . __eou__
thanks __eou__
cool . Good luck , those installers almost never work perfectly first time :P __eou__
otherwise it will only show up for the original admin account ? __eou__
what is unetbootin ? __eou__ I'm running a old version of debian , so I don't have the fancy ubuntu utility yet __eou__ I'll give that a shot , thanks __eou__ unetbootin is doing it 's thing , thanks for pointing me to it __eou__

does bluepill have smth to do with virtualization ? __eou__
Thank you :) __eou__ Is one better than the other ? __eou__
xswat , or addational-drivers MAY hav it . :) iver not looked __eou__

ext4 __eou__
Ok , but how should I mount the dd image after wards . There are 3 partitions on the disk ? __eou__ Also I would prefer an rsync kind of update as that would be faster . __eou__ The netbook is always with me and has a hardware password on its HDD . The external backup will be in my house which is kind of an abusive and difficult environment . Since I don't want evidence etc to be read the backup needs to be encrypted . __eou__ So , its like the netbook is my only computer and its always with me . It contains lots of information that will be indispensable in the future , and should not be accessed by others . Thus I want an encrypted backup on external drive . __eou__ When I image the drive should I dd sda1 sda2 sda4 ... or dd sda __eou__ And how should I mount the resulting image ? __eou__
yes , it looks like it 's going to be trial and error then which is a shame because I have a lot to do . __eou__
Ah silly me __eou__
right but if your drive ever begins to go bad , that data is unrecoverable __eou__
i get the same results as guest __eou__
what 's an example of something else that you run and this happens ? __eou__
Will be able to do that in the next couple of weeks __eou__
hm , maybe it 's not mounted read-write __eou__ What exactly are you trying to do ? __eou__
that wasnt my question ... __eou__ is this your system , or a free shell ? i dindt ask the partition type __eou__
ah __eou__ i appologize __eou__ running the command you gave , before mount it shows root : root as owner , afterwards its my user __eou__
Thanks ; it'll take a few moments , my typing sucks and I want to be concise .. __eou__
You should be able to choose Unity 2D from somewhere like the top or bottom screen __eou__ At the login screen , I mean __eou__
I will give this a try thanks . __eou__ when I run the command I get this " mkdir : cannot create directory **unknown** File exists " __eou__
you don't have to do picture pastes , but it works . try : `sudo apt-get install **unknown** and see what that says __eou__
interesting .. what live cd did you do it with ? __eou__
yes , why not ? __eou__ if an application needs ram , it can easily be droped __eou__
ok . thats for linux ? __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
eww __eou__
I am not looking to use nvidia in VB , I just want to be able to to solve the open gl issue of the host OS that is affecting the VB __eou__
a friend of mine got the same message on the netbook . Now it runs 12.04 and is just very slow . And it was running the beautiful Netbook edition of ubuntu . Now its time for xubuntu . I guess in your case , I would backup home and reinstall 10.04 . __eou__ have a look at this : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeWebCams __eou__
ok , looks like Oracle changed something on that link , this will not work at all for the moment __eou__
you could get fancy and have home for different users on different fielsystems if you wanted . ;) __eou__ its trivial to clean out the old configs __eou__ ive rarely seen the issue happen __eou__
I will look and see if that would do it thanks > __eou__
already have . Not much there . I just can't believe it 's not possible . __eou__
thank you for your help . i will try that and see how it goes . __eou__
and ? __eou__ no 12.10 __eou__
doesn't seem to matter . next event comes in at useless low volume anyway __eou__
forget that ppa , we need more details of your problem first __eou__
netbook __eou__ 1gb ram __eou__ 1.6 ghz duel core processer __eou__
but they should be generated automatically by the interpreter , right ? __eou__
let me test my script there , maybe it is different ( it is working on 12.10 ) __eou__
ok thanks for the help ! __eou__
awesome , learning a lot i should just sit here and read to learn about stuff haha __eou__ haha i understand , thanks for the info __eou__
is the partition mounted read only __eou__ or do you mean the panel on the left in Unity ? __eou__ gotcha __eou__
find | grep desktop __eou__ Edit this : ~/ . **unknown** . dirs __eou__ And make sure everything in that file is like this : **unknown** " $HOME/Desktop " __eou__
Locate file , use last one . Ugh , I was replying to myself . __eou__
what are you trying to do ? __eou__
its a server on rackspace __eou__
but where my files went ? __eou__
backups are only good if you can restore them . test , test and test again __eou__ brainpaid - why does it matter if you uninstall ? just select different DE at login __eou__
and ~/Desktop is now totally empty ? __eou__
grep takes regular expressions or hard coded strings as patterns , you want to search in your input __eou__
http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video __eou__ you'd put it in the MBR , the chroot will allow you to run updates and the newer grub may fly better __eou__
you are more like a brainpain :) __eou__
is your system damaged , it keeps pasting the same thing twice __eou__ I'd look into that __eou__
simply getting Critical error . Could not connect __eou__ so i switch anonymous back on and logged in and it worked find . I'm only getting this with local enable set to yes and anonymous set to no __eou__
Yes . __eou__
your syntaxe gave me an error - " bash : dev/null : file or folder not found __eou__
hahaha __eou__
no its just a different set of apps and desktop and window manager __eou__
its a 3g modem __eou__
ubuntu made me sad a long time ago ;) debian ... __eou__ you can share blame between ubuntu and gnome for that one ... __eou__
10.04 LTS and 10.10 have Gnome 2 . x as DE , Later versions use Unity . __eou__
then you should be installing quantal packages ... __eou__
thanks ! __eou__
but that 's the thing ; it doesn't show up when I search for it , it doesn't seem to tab-complete , and I have no idea what I should call to start it . __eou__ .... ok , nevermind . That 's bizarre . I could have SWORN that I ran apt-get install on it . __eou__ working now , thanks . __eou__
thanks i'll try __eou__
thx for pointing that out __eou__
ok , i will see that , thanks a lot man __eou__

ntfs and ext4 __eou__

all i know was that i recieved a message that my hard drive was full and i couldnt login normally __eou__
no problem , enjoy playing donkey kong __eou__ there was a big snow storm right after I got that game . My cousins and I were basically snowed-in and all we did was play that game :) __eou__ hi __eou__
i know you can , but im always seeing RHEL certs in the job descriptions , not ubuntu :/ __eou__

i dont have that repo __eou__

Hola , something went wrong , I , me , need help , not proposing , sorry for misunderstunding Shure . __eou__ stair dismount , on linux . __eou__
will do zykotick9 __eou__ I got the device to work with ndiswrapper .. but it 's just way to unstable __eou__ **unknown** **unknown** a __eou__
then try to get your drivers going . i dont use ati stuff so cant advise more on that __eou__
you're welcome __eou__
mount /dev/sdc1 /media/usb1 __eou__ sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/usb1 __eou__
real computer of course __eou__
sorry ;-) __eou__
good for you . i had one card that supported nouveau 3d , i was disappointed with the results at the time . best of luck then . __eou__
No wasn't there , but : __eou__
this is what I'm using : flashplugin-installer 11.2 . **unknown** ubuntu 0.12 . **unknown** __eou__
my account is what I don't remember , when I hit enter at the password prompt it keeps asking for a password . I might have enabled root but for the life of me I have tired all my default passwords __eou__
I meant ! password __eou__
gordonjcp : yes i understand that , but the user need not reset the root password following the same steps provided in the link , they can reset their own account , look in /etc/passwd . __eou__
I set one up using the nautilus context menu , it even showed on the other machine , but I cannot mount it __eou__ it is shows the share __eou__
sorry i can't. i don't use ubuntu - someone else ? __eou__ careful if you are using usermod ! without -a it removed all but the one you specify ! __eou__
Go to settings , select the Audio tab __eou__ Fool around a bit with the Output module dropdown box __eou__
I am just using a i7 2600 ( not the k since I need VT-D ) with a mega its crappy GPU and I can do the stuff I am showing here www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WnaZL3ARN0 __eou__
well everybody says the sandy bridge finally qualifies as an elementary apu __eou__ so intel is making progress __eou__
hence I am a Debian GNU/Linux user =) . Zero blobs in the kernel etc . Hope you get it sorted . __eou__
removed years and years ago __eou__ yep .. been xorg for years now ... __eou__
Ok . Thanks for the assistance . Sorry for the probably stupid question . __eou__
I found that answer in a couple of places too , but it doesn't do anything at all . __eou__ I drag the file out of nautilus , hover over the extensions window and in some screenshots I saw it pop up a message saying to drag/drop there , but I don't get that no matter where I hover with the file . And when I let go nothing happens . __eou__
yeah i know .. but what number ? __eou__
cowsay | xargs yes | figlet __eou__

im using lxde i want to remover menu entry OTHER and ive been googlin with luck __eou__
i see a new line __eou__
yea i'm probably going to try that . I was told to use something called " wine " to run windows games __eou__
am new to linux and i can make my own windows manager just yet __eou__
yeah okay , thx anyway :) __eou__
well i am not spending any money for anything unless i find some cheap junk in the junk piles __eou__
what kind of files are you trying to import __eou__
if I try to purge it , it only offers to purge **unknown** . :P __eou__
sudo apt-get install wine ; http://aps.winehq.org __eou__ np , that 's why we are here you know ;P __eou__
lol i knew saying that will bite me in the butt __eou__
i never deleted any file , installed the program downloaded a theme , and selected it via the program __eou__ ive never went beyond changing to a new theme from gnome-look __eou__
I have dowloaded a zip file __eou__ is the iso inside or should I burn the zip __eou__
if you aren't interested in the details then don't worry about it and stick to the default ( ext4 ) __eou__ ext4 unless you are feeling adventerous , in which case you may give btrfs a try ... it 's got some killer features but is still experimental __eou__
that could be , how do I treat it as an iso instead ? __eou__
np . Yes , the ctrl-alt numberpad +/- seemed to cycle through the resolutions . However , it doesn't fix my main problem : all I have is the desktop background . No icons , no menu , nothing . __eou__ ctrl-alt-backspace was changed a few years back because it interfered with handicap usability settings . __eou__ they should be in another tab on your chat client somewhere __eou__ this is not a place to complain . This is a place to ask questions and provide answers . __eou__
i'm afraid i don't know enough to provide any valuable insights : X __eou__
I'm aware of that . __eou__
No . __eou__
I did that __eou__ how can I avoid getting into GRUB __eou__
that 's what I've been saying ;) __eou__
meaning ? __eou__
I'll give that a try then check the site bazhang gave me . Thanks __eou__
is that the only thing it produces ? __eou__
Yes . __eou__ And now that I know that your end goal is to have a LAMP server , I highly recommend that you stop trying to use Xamp and simply install LAMP normally via the repositories ( which will automatically configured it to start at boot) . __eou__
I would need more information than that ... but the long and short of it is that if it cannot be seen by lspci , you cannot use it . __eou__ Yes , it is , and it is why you are here . This is most of what I have done for the last 2 years , is automate driver installs for various hardware , especially GPUs . __eou__ I can give you every possible driver a card can use , but if the system cannot even see the device , it cannot and will not be used . __eou__ your system has to see hardware to use it . This is not a limitation of flexibility ... something is wrong with the card or its seating/power needs __eou__ the biggest problem with X is its archaic nature . What you are saying is nonsense . It has not devolved . __eou__ please power down the system , and check that the card is properly installed . __eou__
mainly I've read that programs designed to work in 32bit won't run in ubuntu 64bit due to missing 32bit libraries __eou__
actually it 's lampp with 2 p 's : http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html __eou__
well , that error you got , i could copy paste it to google and see what comes up and then offer you a link i ' guess ' would be the most helpful , but you being a user of the app might see something more useful from the results if you did the same , still confused ? __eou__
Not entirely certain , I haven't messed with mine since I installed ubuntu , there may be some from google that got added automatically , but that 's it __eou__
I dont think anything changed . Let me paste those someplace . __eou__ http://paste.ubuntu.com/1359485/ /etc/fstab and `df -h ' http://paste.ubuntu.com/1359490/ __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
thanks __eou__
click on terminal and it moves to that window/ .. lets you drag it but it 's still one __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
i have the windows ISO already on USB too , just want to know if the procedure to get back to normal windows would be that easy __eou__
http://paste.ubuntu.com/1359600/ __eou__ Guess it 's the open source drivers , oh well . __eou__
I have an ATI Radeon HD 3100 , which was left out of the loop for the latest proprietary ATI drivers , so I'm stuck using the open source ones , which seem to work well enough for me , but not well enough for Chrome to run WebGL apps , :-( __eou__
i will definitely do that . __eou__
just save __eou__
nothing happend , even I put " date > **unknown** " on the top of script , it shows nothing __eou__

it might tell you why it doesn't upgrade ( missing dependency , conflict , etc ) __eou__ there you go __eou__ next step , same summoning for that dependency to see why it doesn't upgrade __eou__
no , from another Ubuntu into my LAN __eou__ Ok , IPtables and ufw **unknown** the os , but i cant understand why the most insecure os in the world ask before open a port and Ubuntu not __eou__
This channel is not for discussion of technical policy with reguard to Apache . If you want to know how to stop Apache from listening to port 80 , that is a valid support question and we will be glad to help you there . __eou__
you must have a lot of files in your home directory taking up that space __eou__
yeah , I saw that , but wasn't sure which . Wanted to dblcheck before creating and burning . __eou__
clueless __eou__
12.04 has longer support , and will upgrade directly to 14.04 __eou__
if you use the computer with ubuntu on it , it can act as a dns/dhcp server __eou__
the documentation of ffmpeg sucks __eou__ commandline __eou__
if I can't get on the wi-fi , that could be tough , let me see if I can work something out . __eou__
sure , and it lacks proper documentation __eou__ basically the more you read than " man " dumbest you are , should be smarter instead ... __eou__
I have a problem and I want to test if grub is the problem , sometimes when booting , I get a blinking cursor just afret grub __eou__
ah , well , I can't help you with that , never use sftp before . sorry . __eou__
I managed to solve it , I copied the **unknown** . so to /usr/lib/ __eou__
ram=system memory __eou__
thanks .. it just seems to do nothing __eou__
I guess it 's possible , but it 's highly unlikely that you have 21 GiB of RAM in a laptop . __eou__ What is the output of " free -m "? __eou__
sadly no __eou__
you're going to need to start asing the channel now , I'm off to drill holes in lorries __eou__

the problem is i have the script on a remote machine that i can atm access only via VNC and then putty from there , so it would be hard for me to do __eou__
not at all __eou__
argh , didn't know , will join and ask there as well , thanks __eou__
thanks :) __eou__
yes , in a terminal __eou__ yes __eou__
well its in a vm so not sure how the video driver affects that but thanks will give it a try __eou__

it 's about my wimax card - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2084342 __eou__
it gives username and passowrd incorrect . But both the username and password are correct . Is it because i am behind a proxy ? __eou__
in 2 commands yes __eou__
looking , thx __eou__
how about the updates i cannot select on the update manager __eou__
**unknown** ? Nice terminology xD . I'll go see if I can find anything now that I know what it 's called __eou__ looks like I found the answer to disabling the search menu thing here : http://askubuntu.com/questions/122209/how-do-i-modify-or-disable-the-huds-use-of-the-alt-key __eou__
where is the link __eou__
you could try it in /etc/rc . local and see . I don't know the driver or its place in the startup . Alternatively , you could make it a user script that is run when the user logs in __eou__
can you tell me how to get to the setting files ? __eou__ ok i am in ~/ . **unknown** __eou__
OK , after editing it , it works . __eou__ But where can I change it for the virtual consoles ( e.g. ctrl+alt+F1 ) __eou__ Oh , now it works too . Thank you ! __eou__
ok , i will double check them again , but unless i just over looked it there is nothing like that in my files __eou__ ok i found out what is was , i continuously hit '; s ' instead of ' ls ' so i created an alias for it , well i wasn't thinking about __eou__ about ; starting a new command __eou__
You can get it from the Ubuntu software centre , though you may need to enable the " partner repositories " first since it 's proprietary software __eou__
in what unit ? __eou__ or rather , with reference to what ? __eou__
... try #xubuntu . And good luck . :-) __eou__
controls the number of virtual CPUs in the virtual machine . you need hardware virtualization support on your host system to use more than one virtual CPU __eou__
what are your hardware details ? CPU , memory ... __eou__
I want to stream my audio to airbubble on my phone __eou__
Hm . I think your lists are messed up . __eou__ One minute __eou__ I suggest : sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/* /var/lib/apt/lists/* then redo the : sudo apt-get update and try again with : sudo apt-get -f install __eou__
did you enable the ' universe ' repository ? __eou__
and they dont need to say anthing to you .. im just making sure you understand exactly why it can be challenging to work with unsupported software .. though the nomodeset option is the way i sneak in and test and install on most systems __eou__
is that not being made anymore ? __eou__
no sucess with the nomodeset paramater in grub ? __eou__
hey there hows things going __eou__
I shall go & check that now ... __eou__
but it only shows ubuntu 12.10 : S __eou__ i want xubuntu 12.10 __eou__
done that and i got rid of ubuntu desktop now how do i get tYou may have noticed in the release announcement for Beta 1 today from Kate Stewart this line : **unknown** Ubuntu 12.10 , Kubuntu , to upgrade to xubuntu 12.10 he xubuntu updates becasue i want __eou__ done that and i got rid of ubuntu desktop now how do i get the xubuntu updates so i can upgrade to xubuntu 12.10 __eou__
try : sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic-pae __eou__
fresh install __eou__
there aren't the old configs and fluff from the old install causing issues . __eou__ its how the OS is supposed to be , nothing more or less :) __eou__
just tried ' sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda6 ' and it gives me paste.ubuntu.com/1360933/ __eou__ which looks like it 's just formated , non-partitioned data __eou__ also cfdisk says " FS Type " " Free Space " __eou__ no , I want to be sure that I'm not destroying information accidentally . ;) __eou__
afaik fdisk/cfdisk just reads the partition table , it doesn't actually check if there is any data in the partition . So basically .. if everything is ok and in order I would trust them .. but for an old drive that might have some parts go bad I would use one of the other tools , testdisk is one , that actually looks at what is one the disk __eou__ basically it all comes down to how important the data that might be on the drive is .. __eou__
then that would be a 20gb file i have to cart around ? __eou__
bekks : is there no longer a GUI for this in 12.10 ? __eou__
xplico is a tool in **unknown** and could decrypt and categorised the packets . pcap __eou__
but not after reboot :/ __eou__

the result of the command **unknown** __eou__ oops ! is it **unknown** or pciids ? __eou__
no __eou__ just tell me __eou__ you've written it __eou__ what graphics library __eou__ you said you had written it __eou__ right - so what graphics library is it using __eou__ it must be using something to draw the actual display __eou__
i would also test with some other different distros , like puppylinux , tinycorelinux and other live cds __eou__ see if it works with any of them __eou__
don't know what ? __eou__ you've not asked a question __eou__
12.10 __eou__
that doesnt help either ! only wlan0 and lo are listed __eou__
you can print line breaks and such characters in vim to ensure but like they said __eou__ was the file created on a diff OS ? __eou__

open a terminal and type in " glxinfo | grep -i renderer " __eou__
thanks __eou__
is your PC __eou__ Connected to the internet __eou__
do you CLI wiz know if that was added recently ? __eou__ woot : yeah I want a list of files in the directory sorted by file size __eou__ not the size of this dir __eou__
No , not that I recall doing anything like that . __eou__ I see it in iwconfig but not ifconfig . __eou__
also hit " lshw -class network " __eou__
okay , then you have DOS-like line endings __eou__ open the file in vi/vim and try something like ": **unknown** __eou__ without the leading quote __eou__ when you type " < **unknown** > " it should show up as " ^M " and highlighted __eou__
it seems a weird thing to be doing , and isn't entirely supported . why do you want to do this ? __eou__ so what you SHOULD be doing is regenerating that account every time they logout __eou__ otherwise one malicious user can leave a " **unknown** " behind to steal the next users passwords or files __eou__
eth0 not showing up indicates that the proper driver isn't loaded __eou__
i cant imagine what that key would be doing . there really isnt anything in the early boot that listens for keypresses . im guessing the act of pressing the key is causing just enough delay to avoid some kind of race condition in device enumeration ... but it sounds odd . I would try one of the kernel rootwait argumenet __eou__ so in /etc/default/grub on the CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT add " **unknown** " __eou__
i'd rather use vim but everything is showing up as one line when viewing . php __eou__
nano much better ! __eou__
what would you use ? __eou__
thank you __eou__
software center -> preferences iirc , I usually change **unknown** . conf ( or somthing like that ) by hand in vim thou ^ . ^ __eou__ great , danish repo-mirror is probably down atm then :) __eou__
it is a hp pavilion dm 3 . I was running ubuntu 10 before and it was ok . Now with the 12.04 32 bit live usb it is booting __eou__ Ill try to proceed with the install __eou__
maybe graphic is problem __eou__
if you reboot it will probably try to run an fsck and fix it __eou__
beandog .. I sure HOPE it is , as I run the shoutcast station that I'm trying to listen to .. in testing I tried others and they don't work either __eou__
hence " bad idea " __eou__ it won't overwrite everything , __eou__
now that is very useful and I didn't know about that , although reading the docs on it it won't simulate hardware , just the streaming __eou__ is the one who pointed you at it __eou__
anything else ? seeing as you have interwebz on that machine you could paste the entire log on paste.ubuntu.com and I'll have a look :) __eou__
its only going to be for web browsing mainly . So nothing strenuous __eou__
it does back up by default . if u want to view those files , u can however enabk\le them ! __eou__
would it could whitespace and non-printing characters ... yes __eou__ s/could/count __eou__
... that is another question ... that I actually don't know the answer too :P __eou__
sounds good , trying it right away thank you I appreciate it :P __eou__

I think would have to do that , thanks a ton __eou__
thanks ;) __eou__

i'm getting a message along th lines of " kernel panic not syncing out of memory and no killable processes ", been looking on google , not found much ... __eou__
Yep .. thats going to be an issue with most apps expectng at least a 800 pixle tall screen __eou__ there used to be a way to have a larger virtual screen you could pan around . but i never did get it working on my little netbook . __eou__ or look into the paning feature .. but i never got that working __eou__ many apps are hardcoded/expect you to have a monitor of at least 800 pixles tall . __eou__ with low res screens .. yes . One reason i got a better netbook __eou__
well then , even if you removed it there might be bits of it left . Have you had ubuntu long ? and have a look here http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/pureubuntu __eou__ its a way of removing all the bits of ( in your case ) XFCE that you might have installed __eou__
it shouldnt take much longer than a normal make install would __eou__
That 's odd , I thought that it was installed by default ( it certainly used to be) . __eou__
You could have mentioned that earlier ... sounds like they are not using a standard setup/install __eou__
can i switch it to show a woman rather than a man ? It 's gross . __eou__
It 's in Universe . If that 's enabled , " sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install ddrescue " should work for you . __eou__
you are the leader of ubuntu ? __eou__
doesn't seem ifconfig eth0 ### . ### . ### . ### is permanant , I guess I'll just edit /etc/network/interfaces manually __eou__
Okay . I though there could be some way to do it using run-parts .. Ok .. Let me modify my cron to a script :) __eou__
if its ancient then why do you meantion windows7 ? __eou__ i'd have no clue ... actually .. it would probably be better to do non-wubi __eou__ ( the majority fo for non-wubi ) __eou__ ( . **unknown** for __eou__

what 's that ? how do i find out ? __eou__

If you are not sure , please backup your data to safe location from /home/<your **unknown** . It shouldn't cause any harm to data . But just in case __eou__ you said , you were able to open folder on your desktop . open the folder and navigate to /usr/bin/ and double click on firefox binary . Thats it __eou__
aggh this is why you dont run sudo startx . its probably your XAUTHORITY file . __eou__ try " ls -al /home/ansi | grep root " and any files you see there owned by root probably need to be removed __eou__
ubuntu 2d , gnome , kde , xfce , xubuntu , etc __eou__
No idea , I just figured I'd throw it out there so it wasn't missed . __eou__
running off the live cd , installed boot-repair from terminal __eou__
i'm using ubuntu from USB __eou__
I see . So compiling would be the only way . Let 's say , if I already have 1.4 installed , I would download 1.5 source code and compile it and have both working __eou__ why is it possible to install both from the source and not from the deb package ? __eou__
it 's been very difficult to determing how much power it needs . __eou__
no i have the password .. what do u mean ? __eou__ i know the password .. and thats how i have logged in to this session __eou__
that checks for bad blocks and adds them to the bad blocks inode . But I'm not sure if the info stays if the drive is formatted :( __eou__
you should know .. since you're already asking a cli question :) __eou__
no autotools is built for that usecase __eou__ developers tend not to like being unable to compile their program because a dependency is slow to upgrade their version of autotools __eou__
are you in the folder where you unpacked the source __eou__
in any case , i fixed that by following instructions from this post - **unknown** __eou__ but now the kernel wont boot , it can't find the hard drive device by uuid and i don't know where to configure that . older kernel works fine __eou__
i dont know what algorithms there are . you read the data and leave holes where you cant get a good read __eou__ i've heard SSD 's do that ... start reporting they are a lot bigger or smaller than they really are __eou__ http://blog.valerieaurora.org/2008/09/13/to-ssd-or-not-to-ssd/ __eou__ our could probably have an SSD that reports infinite size if one of the block mappings points back on itself __eou__ well now that its started it would be a really bad idea to stop it __eou__
then the resize is faster . the resize will move ~300GB copying off and back is 1400GB __eou__
if its failing mechanically there isn't anything in software that will fix it __eou__ never heard or a command line tool to deal with bad sectors __eou__
really its almost identical to menu . lst __eou__
Yes __eou__ I think i have to install ntfs-config ? __eou__
oh i dint know that thanks for the info ill read on it now __eou__
just keep elaborating for the volunteers here .. " now ", as in , it used to ? what is " it ".. maybe output ' sudo fdisk -l ' in pastebin for reference __eou__

m because once you update grub then windows will be in the grub menu __eou__
on precise ? Anyway , I have to go , but you can do " apt-cache policy PACKAGE ", see what versions are available , then install version VERSION with " apt-get install PACKAGE=VERSION ". I would advise you to read the changelog and see what exactly was updated though . It could be a security fix . Also , make sure you read what apt wants to do . If other packages , depend on a specific version , it might __eou__ want to remove lots of things __eou__
I've git now running __eou__ thanks , have a nice day ! __eou__
yup __eou__
that one is a bit more tricky :/ __eou__
That'll fix grub on another disk as well ? __eou__

i configured USB , reverse tethering to avoid battery draining for wifi __eou__
just typed in the command , is it normal for it to not give any comments while it 's working ? __eou__
Dang ! I thought it would work . But I had no idea Opera was default for xchat :( __eou__
i would just rule out terms like " ought " and just actually test firmly as much as possible .. i would try booting an earlier kernel from grub __eou__ ^^ hold shift as ActionParsnip is suggesting to see an earlier kernel __eou__ i would try any **unknown** .. have you changed any hardware ? added ? removed ? __eou__
yeah , but will that link work when you load the drive in windows ? __eou__

that 's what I was looking for thank you sir ! __eou__
which part of the error should I search for ? I'm looking ... __eou__ dmesg : **unknown** __eou__ ( and thanks for all your help ! much appreciated ! ) __eou__ do you know what err -5 is ? google gives a bunch for err -6 , which is related to fans maybe __eou__ I don't have -6 though . I have -5 . much rarer . The fans are going . I can hear them . __eou__ VGA access ? I can access the plug . __eou__ but that doesn't mean I get output :( __eou__ what else would you recommend logging ? __eou__

actually it _isn't_ compensating , and that 's what creates the error :) what laptop model is it that you have ? :) __eou__
that is obviously correct , don't know why it didn't come to mind . thanks __eou__
great , it worked :) Thanks a lot !!! __eou__
but , that 's just my opinion __eou__ no , it 's horrible , I couldn't wait to get rid of 10.04 __eou__
okay . thanks for clarifying for me :) __eou__
might be easier to just build it from source __eou__
then you need to setup iptables __eou__
I think you've already answered your own question . Anyway , my advice would be that if you want 12.04 software , use 12.04 ... __eou__ why is that you don't just upgrade to 12.04 ? __eou__ 10.04 support will end in april , I'd start thinking about the future __eou__ but 10.04 will no longer be support in april ... it won't be safe to continue to use i __eou__
I downloaded the . debs , it has had no problems so far , I just wanna be sure before I reboot , so I know whever or not to go into Synaptic and un-install . __eou__

so www-data user for apache can read and execute a folder in /home/user/subfolder ? __eou__
depends what you want , one of the closer distros kbuntu or xubuntu will probably cause less pain than some thing for away like mint __eou__ why do you want to install lots of DE 's on the same machine ? __eou__ Why not use VM 's to install the base version of each distro instaed , or do a very minimal install and just install the one you will use . __eou__
Have you tried different distros with same result ? __eou__
i get the error during installation .. How am i supposed to install the missing module/ucode/whatever it is complaining about ? __eou__

I have an ATI Radeon HD 6550D and use fglrx v 9.0 with PlayOnLinux 4.8 . Perhaps that 's your mistake ? Are you installing Wine directly and running l4d2 , or are you using PlayOnLinux to manage Wine for your ? __eou__

well , it turns out installing glew actually was the culprit ... to get fglrx to work i have to apparently use the ( dirty ) fix of symlinking lib64 to lib ... but the install script of glew actually created a lib64 directory overwriting the symlink ... __eou__
I'll rephrase - of the people in the channel right now , it looks like no one else who has the problem knows how to make it work - I would recommend asking later , trying the forums , or filing a bug __eou__

delphi is dead and buried , besides the fact that Delphi for Linux existed . __eou__ So which programming language are you interested in , besides writing M$ Office macros ? __eou__
some 30 people in #ubuntu-app-devel -- you may have to register first __eou__
i am trying it here and ' cdplay ' etc . works ... But no sound output __eou__ probably because of pulseaudio , so looking at it . __eou__ I think laptop CD drives no longer have analog outputs ... __eou__ and in any case my laptop 's audio card has no analog input other than the microphone , so no input from the cd drive . __eou__
yea . theres some other tools like that ive seen for KDE and I think one for nautilus also __eou__
Its certainly unusual that both your cards are not recognized - its usually one or the other __eou__
! wifi > oldman __eou__
maybe you need more spesific languages , there are #pyhton oe ##c __eou__ use gambas ... they mimics vb ' __eou__
contact your mother board manufacturer __eou__
Yeah , you are on a P4 . . . and only 1 GB of RAM __eou__ Those may be your bottleneck __eou__
move on __eou__
: blank screen after booting ...... but 12.04 runs well except 3d support __eou__ help me __eou__
for **unknown** __eou__
hmh yeah just installed and noticed it __eou__
Maybe ther do not run on the standard ports . __eou__
sorry , i did the ! by accident . i meant " ty yeats " __eou__
its just a gutted ubuntu __eou__
no idea . you are in the vast minority __eou__
I don't have an optical drive on that pc __eou__
do you have some random ppa enabled ? __eou__
ok __eou__ is this affects globally ? __eou__
oke , then you didn't install them bij downloading and applying yourself , then forget about this script , not suitable for you __eou__
im pretty sure its just standard ubuntu installed on the root of the device . work needs to be done to improve usability __eou__
I have rsyslogd running . now the flow stopped and I can open syslog , the errors are there , I will paste from pastebin ... __eou__
the don't enable 3D , i've already tried that __eou__ the driver i've downloaded from ati.com worked on ubuntu 10.04 , but won't work on ubuntu 12.10 __eou__
try gnome-session-properties __eou__
then what should i do ? __eou__
Thank you . __eou__
ah ok . Thanks . I just wanted to make sure I wasn't sitting here unnecessarily long . __eou__ what if I changed the partition to fat32 about how long would you say it would take to transfer 950 gigs to it/ __eou__
i get download link for 12.04 only and i am using 64 bit 12.10 __eou__
I've tried both the gui disktool and fdisk from command line __eou__ might if you used xfe as yer desktop but still __eou__ use it as a lilttle server for something/ __eou__ any idea why it would be confussing the CD drive with the HDD ? __eou__
I belive theres some way to set up ~/ . **unknown** entries for specific desktops via editing the . desktop file for the entry __eou__ the /etc/xdg/autostart/ files may show some examples of doing this . ivbe noticed it for kde and gnome __eou__ or you may be able to create your own mate+docky session for the login maanger __eou__
are there commercial boxes/safes available like that ? __eou__
from what ive seen . either a webcam works .. or is totally unsupported with no drivers . its possible theres some experimental drivers for it . or somthing comming up in newer kernels . __eou__
but , i have a full bucket of fish here for the dayly feeding session :) __eou__
Thanks . If I'm unable to find one which works , I'll try and find a work around __eou__
what error __eou__ are you sure it 's not asking for your WPA password __eou__
then you dont want to be adding any debian repositories at all if you want to keep apt happy __eou__
ZNC is CLI ... __eou__ you could download and compile the tarball ( source code ) manually though __eou__
is it same as . gtk-bookmarks ? __eou__
Yes , but later I cannot update that package without uncommenting .. __eou__
they do ? shouldn't dconf settings stick even on updates ? __eou__
did you remove the nvidia driver using CLI ? __eou__ drop to cli and log in and run : sudo chown -R $USER : $USER $HOME __eou__ sounds like you need to fsck the partitin __eou__ just boot to the liveCD and check the file system , no need to reinstall . __eou__ fsck read the man page __eou__
deployer is in sudo group . that is ok ? __eou__
that works for resolving external IPs ; however , I can't ping any internal PCs by name still __eou__
escott i just did fsck /drive __eou__ escott and it seems to be auto-cleaning ? __eou__
that got it . thanks :D __eou__
Yes , but did you enable a PPA to have the beta drivers ? __eou__
it doesn't do anything , i can only spin the desktop cube , and its at a lower resolution __eou__ **unknown** this is true for both desktop environments i can log into , both xfce and ubuntustudio __eou__ im running nvidia 310 drivers , w compiz cube , it was working perfectly and i changed a setting on the taskbar ?? any thoughts m8s :/ __eou__ any thoughts friends ? __eou__
perhaps not . i dont know i dont bother with encryption __eou__ just trying to list all the things that could break a /boot __eou__
thank you ... additional info = I just upgraded the machine in question from 11.04 > 11.10 > 12.04 and then rebooted . I have not done anything else . The contents of /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades are just the **unknown** contents . __eou__ Any suggestion what I ought to do ? __eou__
is possible __eou__
It 's a bit late to be switching off it . __eou__
you can try fsck . ntfs , and then try to mount __eou__ if don't work the only thing to do is use dd_rescue , ask friends for a disk of 1TB __eou__
wht does " touch /media/9D[TAB]/test output __eou__
A while ago . Came up with about six different sites with the same info , and then I looked at Ubuntu and realized there 's no single Xorg . conf __eou__
empathy should be there , make sure telepathy-indicator is installed __eou__
on which system , do I need to install it on the guest ? __eou__
okay , well you could free up space on your hdd to boot both natively , rather than relying on windows for ubuntu __eou__
and ? __eou__
no , I'm pretty sure I don't _need_ to install it firstly . Gparted is included in the live session . __eou__ I have troubless with starting ubuntu live sessions . __eou__
no , do-release-upgrade doesn't have that as a parameter . I just found I have to edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades - thanks for giving it a shot . __eou__
bekks -- awesome ! __eou__
would turning off my smbd would work ? __eou__
same difference :) __eou__
ich mean NotifyOSD __eou__
thanks , i will look into that . __eou__ my fstab file looks nothing like the one in the example i was reading . how can i copy the contens of my fstab file to pastebin ? I can copy/paste in nano but not outside of it . __eou__
tried the oracle java ? __eou__
well I can't do anything cause of video lag ... __eou__
that 's good __eou__
Thanks __eou__
where to get help for this issue on irc ? #aircrack is invite only do you know how to get a invite to a channel ? __eou__ it worked ok before like 4 days ago __eou__
i tried to get ubottu to give a factoid about trim but she doesn't have one __eou__ its just a package , like any other __eou__
ah it 's ok , works after running boot-repair __eou__
I've found a PPA for 3.8 . in Precise __eou__ sudo add-apt-repositry ppa : **unknown** ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade __eou__
it is ntfs filesystem , friends(windows user ) HD that has label My Book __eou__ is there anyway to get fstab to accept space ? __eou__
but you can still run into broken webapps with open java __eou__
locate is the bom __eou__
so can i list dependencies for 32 bit binaries on a 64 bit system __eou__
what about default repos ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
hehe __eou__
my only parition is fedora __eou__

aha , this is the trick :-) __eou__ thanks __eou__
thanks __eou__
yeah , so i see __eou__
very crazy .. nautlis show everything ... and Ubuntu install not show /dev/sda ... and I use this same installation yesterday , no problem . __eou__
" Deamon sartup failed ." __eou__
this is interesting but i'm more looking for a list of a few packages to be able to log into the desktop and have the system tools and maybe firefox __eou__
Not sure then . __eou__
bt : hostname __eou__ can you solve me my problem __eou__ i'm trying to install nautilus- 3.7 . 1 , during . /configure , it gave me that error __eou__
give me one second . __eou__ What do you want to admin ? __eou__
i would say that it is still working . __eou__
cat /var/log/installer/syslog | grep " **unknown** " __eou__
trying that __eou__
ya , nm __eou__ sorry found it opened on my windows partition , freaked out __eou__ do you know of a windows channel ? __eou__
press Ctrl+L and you'll get an address-bar where you can type absolute paths in :) __eou__
documentation should end up in /usr/share/doc/PACKAGE . But the command **unknown** dpkg -L PACKAGE **unknown** will reveal to you all files that PACKAGE installed __eou__
not landed on any yet . Testing various with varying frequency as Gnome being one of them . __eou__
I want to reach at " **unknown** " through GUI __eou__
lol what am I watching __eou__
Okay , thanks , will do __eou__
I use apt directly too , ask fishscene __eou__
Yep . __eou__
so how do I use this environment once it is installed ? __eou__
i bought sitecome usb adapter and linksys pci recently , the both worked flawless on ubuntu __eou__ try ##hardware aswell __eou__
xfce is easy to configure and stay 's out of your way . __eou__
what codec would you like this program to use ? __eou__ its done . http://pastebin.com/u/Onryo the one posted 2 min ago . __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
but I am a Alfa nut . If you can get hold of this one . Also works right out of the box Alfa AWUS050NH __eou__ I would turn off IPv6 . I really might help . __eou__ I use Iceweasel . __eou__
there isn't one __eou__
sure , download the source and happy hacking :) __eou__
i want the session menu to appear first . the menu where you can choose between ubuntu , ubuntu 2d etc . whats it called ? i dont recall enabling autologin ; i was able to switch between different options prior to selecting kde __eou__
somehow I don't think so bkc_ __eou__ had a go at ##apple . Seems like their corporate outpost . __eou__
was it installed via deb/apt/synaptic ? __eou__ use synaptic to find it , un-install it there __eou__ no luck at what ? __eou__ of course it stays the ' same ' you re-installed it , it wont change its behavior __eou__ its not windoz __eou__
hmm ? __eou__
=) __eou__
thanx ... I was looking for a way not to use external devices .. but anyway nice to hangout with ubuntu community bye __eou__
/dev/sda4 /media/Storage ntfs-3g defaults 0 0 __eou__ ActionParsnip can you give me which user I need to add __eou__
haven't tried much at all myself . I am not too familiar with commands etc to resolve this and I'm not in front of the machine unfortunately __eou__
sorry , it is allow , not enable __eou__
Yo , no problemo . __eou__
we live and learn . You've learned to df -h when services don't start up as expected ... __eou__
: oops , this means i have locked myself . no local help . Any tips for backup so that i can reinstall it remotely __eou__
stop what ? __eou__
space is space , is all i mean . __eou__
how to find a file called just " foobar ", but not foobar01 , and especially a file but not a directory . I used locate foobar but it shows me manythings which I don't search . __eou__ :) __eou__
not a problem __eou__
not a problem __eou__
hello , thank but the live cd resolution is very very hihg and i can't read screen font 's __eou__
thankssssss __eou__ you're so cool . you actually tried to help already with this issue : https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+question/208473 __eou__
so maybe this problem will go away and I will have normal boxes again ? __eou__
when i try with vlc it shows , Your input can't be opened : VLC i s unable to open the MRL'v4l2:///dev/video0'.check the log for details __eou__
again - do not disable journaling with ext4 __eou__
I know how it works , just fed up with having to clean stuff , reconfigure cuz /boot is full __eou__ I probably did , still doesn't mean I want 30 kernel versions :) __eou__
mmm which java is better ? __eou__ so the candidates are open java and oracle java right ? __eou__
so you don't have installed any kind of **unknown** ( oracle | openjdk ) .. use please apt-get or aptitude to isntall that __eou__
ok thanks - just the brand to choose now __eou__
have a look at the contents of the script , it 's probably just a wrapper around the upstart commands __eou__
i would say ext4 is the biggest advantage . but you dont want journaling . so the choice is very limited . __eou__
ah , sorry . If you have a bunch of names like " **unknown** ", " **unknown** " and so on , you can easily rename them to " **unknown** ", " **unknown** " and so forth . What is it you want to do more exactly ? A simple terminal for loop could also be helpful . __eou__
Yeah , plus sometimes I think I can hear that peculiar sound HDD do when they're beginning to fail . __eou__
you don't need to turn it off . Just log out and you'll be taken to the login screen . From there , you can find a gear or circle next to your username . When you click on it , you can choose a different session . If you've installed fluxbox from the repositories , fluxbox should be a choice __eou__
I am glad you were able to pick that out just from the visual cues , something I can't do . I don't know why you think I did not notice initially , I did . All users of the system are affected after the upgrade to precise __eou__
want me to paste it to the page you gave me before ? __eou__
error : Cannot recv data : Connection reset by peer __eou__ error : failed to connect to the hypervisor __eou__
yeah and in my experience Ubuntu picks up quickly on Intel video and uses the right driver ... not heard of this happening with Intel before __eou__ I would search online for the right driver package for your card and apt-get install it __eou__ does lsmod show you have a video driver loaded ? __eou__
like ? __eou__
_netdev is depreciated __eou__
" graphics driver lost after ubuntu update " __eou__ somthing like that __eou__
I am well aware of the nature of this channel , thank you __eou__ had anyone said that they played the game I would have asked further questions , obviously . As they did not I didn't. __eou__
well what do you suggest ? __eou__ looks like any progress will have to stop here for now ... the battery just died and I don't have the charger on me . Thanks for trying though :) __eou__ mind assisting me with checking PMs on irssi ? I seem to be failing all over myself . __eou__
I know that __eou__
No . screen is a program that provides the functionality you seek __eou__ tmux is also such a program , which is newer , better but not as commonly available __eou__
i figured it out . i misspelled something :) __eou__
Kerberos is what provides happieness :-) __eou__
like ubuntu one - like games - and so on __eou__ : its installed with ubuntu when i was installing ubuntu it self __eou__
quite possibly , yes __eou__ is there any progress indication ? Does the drive show any signs of activity ? __eou__
is there a way to check the current root __eou__ is there a way to check the current root ? __eou__
i thought that was a very common question ... __eou__
sorry but I do not know how to remove the linux emta packages . :( __eou__
ok . I posted the wrong command earlier . I thought that was the issue . __eou__ yeah , that 's an issue __eou__
I wasn't suggesting it was , merely pointing out there seem to be a lot of changes in ubuntu , that we don't see in kubuntu __eou__
thank you ! __eou__
hardware issues like ? the drives work just fine under normal kernel __eou__
gksu gedit /etc/apt/sources . list and add that whole line to the end __eou__
my synaptics says I already have it installed . __eou__
I had exactly that , choose on install /dev/sdc and also place bootloader on **unknown** __eou__
will try my best to not use enter __eou__
brb __eou__ : headers where installed so I just reinstalled radeon driver __eou__ ? __eou__
thanks , I will check . Also , I have 11.04 , is there a way to upgrede directly to 12.04 , or I have to go through 11.10 first ? __eou__
cannot open mixer : No such file or directory __eou__
we don't know how the elementary guys changed things __eou__
but unetbootin supports only up to 12.04 version __eou__ is it still okay ? __eou__
type ffmpeg -formats | grep mp __eou__
k thanks __eou__
: its based on 12.04 ! __eou__ yes and i was wrong , i checked __eou__ there is as much difference between ubuntu and elementary than between ubuntu and kubuntu , so now lets just fix my problem , which isn't related to ubuntu ( it was doing the same thing on debian ) __eou__
try install firmware-b43-installer __eou__
theres no driver for your sound card :/ __eou__
dude tried that procedure .. but there is no drift file to delete __eou__
nevermind . Restarted terminal and now it 's working __eou__
can i get that in english it out put all germen or something lol __eou__
Yes __eou__
theres dozens of tools at the pendrivelinux web site also __eou__ i tnd to use the pendrive linux tools or just image the iso straight to flash __eou__ you did verify the md5 of the iso file ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
ok hold on ill pastebin it __eou__
Try congiguring X , with " X -configure ". __eou__
sorry i dont know i am not using gnome classic so i dont know __eou__
I used to use fedora , and I think it was set up by default , I assume it is a standard package that has what I need , __eou__
I know . My computer died randomly and it messed up python horribly ( it couldnt recognize native modules ) __eou__
how do I do that ? __eou__
i think they are open for constructive critism . but that is not what you said in the channel here . so lets focus on the support topics :) __eou__
i want to increase the number of nofiles that nginx can open ( the user is www-data ) __eou__
I wonder where I'd reach them ... __eou__
no , that would be an " open mail relay " - deeply frowned upon __eou__
from what I read it 's lot more mature than Unity ... __eou__
totem ? __eou__ what is the path for totem ? __eou__
no , its a fallback modus for gnome3 ( gnome-shell ) and is now removed for 13.04 because they use llvmpipe __eou__
okay , now you're whining , and i'm not going to respond to whining . __eou__
that was way in the bottom of the changelog , I thought it should be near the top . __eou__ Many thanks~ __eou__ Found it as well . __eou__
I do not know that much about light dm maybe if you tell it to start at all points in orca settings __eou__
i know but i need to know where its found usr/bin usr/sbin **unknown** **unknown** ..???? __eou__
alright thanks i'll take a look __eou__
yeah __eou__
who confirms it ? __eou__
I'm a bit of a newbie , you mean to type that into the root command line , correct ? __eou__
I'd fsck the partition in liveCD , make sure it is healthy __eou__
those messages sound **unknown** . whatever you have plugged into sdb is write through __eou__
ikonia I've been through most of /var/log ( all of the mail* files ) and don't see anything . I looked in dovecot too , but didn't think that was the culprit anyway . __eou__
i know that , i wasnt sure if they had actually dropped that package though __eou__
sry , but please stick to the guidelines . __eou__
well , i think oem is a little bit to fat for that .... isnt there an easy way to say " you need a new password ... if u dont want to set a new one , shutdown your machine "? just for one time ? __eou__
Don't be , in 2010 the MBP had the best battery life . Asus had the cloest specs but the same price ... __eou__
I think it could preserve my hard links , but if I don't have it yet . How is it possible ? I didn't find this option on it __eou__
check askubuntu.com perhaps - they tend to have some decent guides . could be you need the hplip package for hp printers . __eou__
rsync will do it with hardlinks with one of the options .. __eou__ -- **unknown** __eou__
oh so like AES ? __eou__
dr_willis idk which one to choose __eou__
Try the basics first : 1 ) make sure everything is turned on and plugged in , 2 ) have you tried turning it off and on again ? 3 ) what does ifconfig say ? can you ping anything by ip ? __eou__
the installer has like 3 options . ' install alongside ' ' use whole disk ' and ' somthing else ..." ( which lets YOU customize the disk partions ) __eou__ my normal partion layout for widnows 7 -- > ( windows boot partion ) ( windows main partion ) ( linux /) ( linux swap ) __eou__ dependng on your setup you do it how you need . __eou__
ah nice , now i can look at the process , thanks __eou__
from cd about a year ago . today i've installed windows 8 and the bootloader is gone . i'm sure ubuntu is still there . __eou__
gedit is a text editor , a pretty nifty one but not a calendar __eou__ ok pluging in thunderbird , that makes a bit of sense , I'll give that a try __eou__
honestly not sure on the sizing . I'm planning on just splitting my 500GB hd in two - 250 for ubuntu , 250 for xp __eou__
there are two ways i can think to do this . __eou__ 1 ) let linux handle the USB device and pass the raw device /dev/sdb or the like to windows , or 2 ) find the usb location with lsusb and pass the USB device to windows . in either case you would do this through the VBox configuration __eou__ what is your native language __eou__ trying to run this through google translate is not going to be very effective __eou__ im not sure what to tell you . you need to make changes to the Virtual machine configuration in the vbox manager __eou__ http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/virtualbox-usb.html __eou__ or https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=45161 __eou__
errr , ok thanks __eou__
You can use the vbox configs to set it up as a vbox share , or set it up as a samba share , or just use winscp on the windows in vbox , and ssh on the linux side __eou__ that will confuse him even more . ;) __eou__
yea , that 's what I don't know ... I assume since I've grabbed the vmliuz from the same cd it -should- work ... __eou__
then you are sitting around with packages coming from the PPA and have no PPA backing them __eou__
what does that screen look like ? __eou__
I'll give it a shot . Hard to do all this at exploded resolutions when everythings off screen __eou__
Try the nvidia one __eou__
i did ... nothing special .. installed 12.10 , installed the flash stuff .. it worked ... __eou__
try -A -P0 -T4 -v __eou__
hmmm ... i use flash all the time , seems to work fine for me __eou__
yes i know but the fullscreen is broken even in the latest chrome dev on my box __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ it even wont work with chrome and its ppapi __eou__
one minute __eou__
no . i have one . cpp file and I want to learn how to make the deb package using the tutorial on ubuntu __eou__
:) __eou__
I thought that 's what you were doing __eou__
it 's possible , you also might need to update your motherboard bios , I know of some mobos that had faulty pci-e buses that had problems with certain cpus , most were fixed with a firmware upgrade __eou__
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade __eou__
It 's a KMS driver , so the code is technically in kernel , so in that sense I would say against linux , but you'll probably get better debug info from " ubuntu-bug xorg " so do that instead . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
no , not related to Ubuntu . __eou__
kill **unknown** ? __eou__
I tried updating my AMD catalyst drivers but they're notorious for being broken __eou__
also , I don't have internet " sessions " __eou__
wow , mine went away __eou__
when i print the usage , it says **unknown** ! __eou__
As previously stated this is a VM without access to the host therefore I can't add other media __eou__
That doesn't prepare USB drives to be booted via UEFI ( or didn't last time I looked) . __eou__
You have a very odd configuration because this is a hosted container , not a default Ubuntu install . __eou__
it 's a mode of unetbootin to boot an iso from a hard drive if you don't have a usb drive .. __eou__
so what is the problem ? __eou__
yes ? __eou__ i dont get those , ignore all __eou__ did you have a question ? __eou__ network issue ? pinged it ? __eou__ the npt client pointing to the correct ip/port ? __eou__ that means nothing to me , lets see the conf for the client and the deamon __eou__ lets see the conf for the client and the deamon , pastebin them __eou__ look at the ntp log too for anything abbynormal __eou__
aha ! ubuntu is booting __eou__
I'm not able to get x11vnc working after recent update . I've reconfigured DM for kdm over lightdm and here are the working , failed attempts - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1367286/ . What am I missing in the command ? __eou__ ? __eou__
yes , i did that already but the messages won't go away __eou__
the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= " quiet splash " line ? __eou__
ZOMG YOUR COMPUTER IS BROADCASTING AN IP ADDRESS ! __eou__
just a blank screen __eou__
Just trying to get linux on this netbook that i have .. __eou__
all I'm seeing is apt-demon and avahi-daemon __eou__
i would say you are missing dev files/packages from the looks of it __eou__
thanks __eou__
i have no idea . __eou__
what does sudo lshw say ( in a pastebin please ) __eou__ your t60 has no net connection ? __eou__
sorry i mixted you up with someone asking for help with graphic __eou__
https://gist.github.com/21beab517334c88ec828 __eou__
its highly illegal __eou__ well , you friend is an idiot and now stop that topic please __eou__
this is not an ubuntu issue , go find a hacking channel , we do not support this . __eou__
there 's no information on how to install that game . __eou__
still , even with pae applications can't use more than 4 gb __eou__
then just : sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade __eou__
do they have an irc channel or smthng ? __eou__
No i'am using Kubuntu and have also installed ubuntu-desktop __eou__
I will try the text installer , and be back later ... __eou__
of course , thats why im asking about it __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
MonkeyDust ... well could be .. it is just hard to tell __eou__ ... at least some games do work like the 3d psemu stuff like final fantasy and legend of dragoon __eou__ MonkeyDust ... but losing supertuxkart was a real loss just like blender __eou__ especially since blender is getting some elementary sterioscopic rendering __eou__
thanks you !! __eou__
;) __eou__
Monkey well i finally found a way to change the default drivers in x ... so i got glxgears running on the ati ... so then i decided to see if supertuxkart would work ... it did until i installed restricted stuff ... which took out the avcodec libs ... and supertuxkart quit working __eou__ MonkeyDust ... well could be .. it is just hard to tell __eou__ ... at least some games do work like the 3d psemu stuff like final fantasy and legend of dragoon __eou__
no idea then , sorry __eou__
Local computershop dude says it will . __eou__ What would you recommend then ? __eou__
it makes 1000 the owner of the files in that folder __eou__
dotfiles ? __eou__ ok , i'll try reinstalling them i guess . this crap seems to happen on every upgrade __eou__
give the output of lspci|grep VGA __eou__
could you please remember me which was the program to remove journaling on 12.04 or 12.10 ? __eou__
where can i find deb packages for intell hd graphics __eou__
If you have precise-security and precise-updates enabled you shouldn't be having this issue . I have both enabled here and I see the proper package versions fine ( and apache is installed and working ) __eou__
thanks , ill check there __eou__ although i was pretty sure that they all use the same package repository , only with different packages to be installed by the installation media __eou__ deb http://de.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal main restricted __eou__
how do I get the uid ? __eou__
sounds neart __eou__
Yes , when it is installed vanilla , I excecuted the command sudo **unknown** / -v and i set the discard , **unknown** in /Etc/fstab __eou__
if you allow the OS or gparted to partition , it will be correct . As long as its a current OS . I think Ubuntu 11.10 on up , or windows 7 on up __eou__ be sure to update the ssd drive 's fireware __eou__
Hm , looks good to me ... But then again it *is* working now so that 's no surprise __eou__
yes it is fresh installed __eou__ Will check it __eou__ On the top of the drive there is no label , but this is the site : **unknown** __eou__
just search for " convert to mdadm RAID1 " __eou__

from there you just need to turn on auto hide __eou__
unfortunately so , but at least you will be supporting the cause __eou__

so this will allow from what range of ip addreses : sudo ufw allow from 192.168 . 1.0 /24 - 192.168 . 1.0 to 192.168 . 1.24 ? __eou__ what if I want to ban 192.168 . 0.0 to 192.168 . **unknown** __eou__

Hello . If i insert a HDD in computer A with one hardware configuration , and install ubuntu , and later take that hdd with the ubuntu installation and insert it in another computer with a different hardware configuration , will the installation then work and also will it be altered ? Is there a possibility that the installation will be corrupted ? __eou__
bah humbug ! __eou__
ok , in that case try ' sudo apt-get install libgnomeui-dev ' __eou__
everyone needs scanner hosts , and cable lines are PERFECT for that . and **unknown** . i run a hackable OpenVZ container , and i just had someone root that just the other night .. i ended up stealing 4MB of their scripts , code , binaries and all that to report . __eou__

sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 mysql-server phpmyadmin __eou__ install the lamp packages directly with the command i gave you __eou__

you can also use http://goodbye-microsoft.com/ it is a **unknown** . exe , can click it from XP let it do its thing , reboot __eou__ i guess maybe ideal would be to have the former Windows machine as a VM in the new Linux afterwards .. not sure with free software but vmware converter could do such things ( convert physical to vm) . then it is a handy " disk file " that can be moved around and started anywhere __eou__ the " **unknown** . exe " is different , it does a " real " install after reboot ,, but it is Debian __eou__
the installer has a dialog/question where it asks ' use the whole disk ' you just say yes .... __eou__ you may want to use Lubuntu on it - if it has low specs . __eou__ there is no longer a netbook remix __eou__ you should test with a live usb to be sure your networking/wireless is working also __eou__

correct - it has been discontinued __eou__
often you can , but the big question is whether there is indeed a defect . It is likely , but first check the log . __eou__
been there , tried that . Tried -numerous " solutions " - None have worked so far __eou__
in /var/log/ are the logs . maybe there is a hint why its getting delayed . __eou__
yes , and it 's even broken in 12.04 __eou__
no , but it was found by doing " xinput -- list " __eou__
ok dmesg add somme error after the update try __eou__
**unknown** , MonkeyDust I already got it , just " whereis **unknown** " thanks for your care :) __eou__
well , yes I know , but dch always appends " ubuntuX " when I do dch -i . can I stop it from doing that ? __eou__
or you can use lspci which should tell you the vendor name laso __eou__ what is the ouput of sudo lshw -C display - specifically line configuration : ..... __eou__ what error is wine throwing ? __eou__
hmmm __eou__
hee ty but how do i get the javur __eou__ to get the . jar __eou__
what ouput do you get from screen or does the server not even get to the point of booting the cd ? Can you take a picture of the screen where it fails and send it to me somehow so I can advise , also if your server supports usb booting I would advise doing that rather than cd but thats just a matter of opinion but ubuntu supports both , try usb for time being __eou__
problem solved linux is case sensetive windows is not __eou__
I've tested out to remove it , but when I log in , then I haven't ANY file handler on my desktop . I must start nautilus manually . __eou__
don't see anything in syslog __eou__
that doesn't restart the hardware ... that just resets the config applied . __eou__ the problem is that the card won't detect link , but there is no reason for it , there is link and the driver works as the primary card is using the exact same driver __eou__
can you paste the exact command and error in **unknown** so i cant take a look __eou__
thats actually what ive been trying , but when i boot to a livecd or anything else , there are no sd* devices in /dev/ __eou__

That 's a great idea , hadn't thought of that :) __eou__
uh ... what ? __eou__ **unknown** might be one place to put stuff __eou__

its not a simple text file , I mean why do I have to use a tool ?: ) __eou__
that is what i was about in the first place __eou__
can you paste the line showing the device in " lsusb "? __eou__ it should work with the rt2870 without ndiswrapper . maybe there is a need to block rt2800usb __eou__
Sorry , **unknown** seems to have left us . __eou__

I'm switching the location to my on board SSD drive that 's embedded to the laptops board . I just haven't been using the storage so I figure I could try and utilize the space while the ram being 8 gig 's itself I see no problem with the switch . Do you understand what I'm doing . I'm only asking here so I don't go screwing up and save myself hours of headaches __eou__

I think it is enough to have them displayed in bottom of software center by default . but it is annoying enough to offer non-free software in free software OS . Let alone putting those on my main user interface could be classified as too much aggressive advertising , Maybe even illegal in some places . __eou__ It is not question of just revenue . It is question of my privacy being selled in main OS GUI to some third party companies directly , together with my IP address . And forcing users to watch advertising in their regular everyday work . Like Ubuntu is moving advertising OS . __eou__
so remove it __eou__ if it 's that big a deal , recommend that your users use xubuntu __eou__
i'll give that a go __eou__ no , lsusb fails to return the device __eou__
then I suggest you do and that you put your halt on privacy issues with ubuntu to a latterday conversation __eou__
you said something ; you didn't answer the question . __eou__ for new users , it is spying , I agree . However , once you are made aware of it , you can easily turn it off . __eou__
why is that ? __eou__
when you enter anything inside dash home . __eou__
in which case I clearly don't understand your question __eou__
I beg to differ on that one depends on the damage on the vehicle :P Military service anything can happen on the fly __eou__

well , the kernel updates from ubuntu worked flawlessly previously ... __eou__ i even sudo apt-get install nvidia-current -- reinstall __eou__
then whats the point of this . You installed backtrack for its apps , if you wanted ubuntu you would install plain ubuntu . __eou__
oh ok i see it lol __eou__ idk man when was the last time you rebooted ? __eou__
perhaps a screenshot would help __eou__

differnt video cards would be an issue . but not too hard to correct __eou__
: type the command : alsamixer __eou__
you'd need to backup your data and reinstall . That 's when drivers are established and installed based on that hardware of that system . __eou__
press alt and grab the titlebar from that window and push it beyond the screen __eou__
so it already has it installed ? __eou__
then why is there no detection of my hardware ? e.o __eou__
yes __eou__
found anything interesting ? __eou__
ifconfig __eou__ because its listed in lspci __eou__ seems like its this one : http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1741686.html __eou__ wait ? you want a wifi card or lan card ? __eou__
which ubuntu is that exactly ? or is it mint ? __eou__ with cinnamon from a ppa ? __eou__ that is caused by the mint ppa . so i think the mint guys should know how to fix their stuff __eou__
yes . /tmp is tmpfs , btw __eou__ you could probably modify your web server 's upstart script to handle that . __eou__
try ... location ~ **unknown** . php { gzip off ; } __eou__
mind if i pm you __eou__
probably __eou__
I know with windows I've had issues , but I thought linux would handle it fine . Cool , thanks ! :) __eou__

whats that ? __eou__
Maybe you should explain your situation in more detail . ( I was under the impression that your system will not boot without ethernet cable plugged in . ) __eou__ Does it hang during boot ? __eou__
it does , but it waits for like 5 min for a network connection , and then has no networking __eou__ how exactly do i disable it ? __eou__ network manager does not display the connection at all , that is my problem __eou__ but ifconfig shows it fine __eou__

Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT . __eou__
what about transmission or deluge ? __eou__
have a look in the software centre __eou__
port 80 ? :D __eou__
problem is that their documentation sucks , I don't even know what I'm supposed to do . " Please add the library files to your distribution libraries in case of malfunction ." is all I have to go on ... __eou__ I put them there , it didn't work __eou__
How would I copy text while in a virtual console ? __eou__ I'll get the text , but it would be more efficient if I didn't have to write it down . __eou__
do i need to reboot ? __eou__
yes and I don't know how to install latex packages in Ubuntu __eou__
it depends on what you are hosting . for people to visit the site you just need 80 . if external people need access to the box you can enable ssh , but usually 3306 is closed by default __eou__ only if someone needs direct access to the database from somewhere besides the physical machine __eou__ ( in most cases they don't ) __eou__
it should __eou__
yeah . . . . that looks like it 's expecting the 32 bit and you have a 64 bit os installed , yes ? __eou__
can you give example ? __eou__
and in firefox check your add-ons>>Plugins list , see if you have the IceTea plugin installed there __eou__
iirc __eou__
I would sugest a duel boot but I woudn't want to screw with that without a working laptop :( __eou__ I'm sure it 's some M$ trickery __eou__
32 to 64 bit shift will cause problems for data , right ? __eou__
I dont know if is only me : When I put a drive usb , the mount directory now is /mount/username/usb1 __eou__

I'm not finding anyother solutions except the one link I sent you .. not sure what the deal is with the permission denied .. never encountered that __eou__

That is true , usb unctionality can sufer at points . I haven't run ino issues in some time , but I don't have any idea regarind adb :( __eou__

no problem I will be there Actually the hack you gave me is running __eou__
do you know if those CD 's are **unknown** 44.1 kHz __eou__ Wish I'd thought of that , lol __eou__
This person seems to have a similar problem , and fixed it with a firmware update : **unknown** __eou__ Wait . __eou__ I just found out about a command called " cdparanoia " which might help . __eou__ If nothing else , it might tell you what 's wrong . __eou__ I'm going to sleep soon :) __eou__ And I'm curious how this goes , so if you don't mind please keep me informed if cdparanoia works , or if you ever figure out more . __eou__
Probably because it 's more graphic intensive . __eou__
I read that on forum but that happen on physical server , my Ubuntu VM is not presented with any graphics memory __eou__
sounds like you don't want to be helped or try something new , then __eou__
taking a look __eou__
What kind of error did it give you ? Or ... what was the problem ? __eou__ I know that it works . I've done it numerous times . __eou__ Do you have the drive booted up now ? Or do you have it plugged in ? __eou__ If so , show me ; sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit __eou__ May be that you just didn't understand how to operate gparted 's interface . __eou__ Try again and look closely at the options . __eou__ What live CD are you using ? See : http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php __eou__ http://gparted.sourceforge.net/ **unknown** Help tab for more info . __eou__

I guess I COULD start paring away any suspect entries in there , but none seem problematic __eou__ my output is same or similar to that link .. thanks for pointing that out __eou__
it 's called TreeStyle Tab , also the TabGroups manager __eou__
Is your 12.04 system running notify-osd ? __eou__
is that all it is then ? __eou__

It 's the same ( and sometimes worse ) trying to buy hardwre for a Win7 64bit box . I know . I had to get a WiFi card for one at the VFW post and I found 2 that didn't work . There were 32bit drivers but not 64bit . You could install the card , install drivers ( wouldn't even designate whether it was 32 or 64bit , and you could install a driver that turns out it was 32bit and just didn't work) . __eou__ But I think your chances are very good - that one will be ok . __eou__
given the specs of the Pi . ;) that fact it worked decently well is amazeing .. but my Pis are on backorder . __eou__
i think it worked , thank you __eou__
Number ? .. __eou__
thanks __eou__
you get the idea __eou__
My drivers are included in the kernal . I bought the wifi card specifically because of that . __eou__
the " Additional **unknown** " program should help you with nVidia drivers . Have you seen that program ? __eou__
: not all issue are solved in fresh install . for 12.04 i have done 2 to times fresh install then most of the problem are solved __eou__
At the last of the kernel line . Space and then text __eou__
I have ATI/AMD and i don't know specifics of nVidia driver installation __eou__
gnome-shell is in the official repos too __eou__
, i cant select shutdown a 2nd time cause it shuts down at a point where the gui isnt present __eou__
Encore **unknown** **unknown** . Dmesg says a lot of things heh __eou__
about ? __eou__
nevermind it was a setting from ati to move the image on the second monitor closer to the edge __eou__
I see~ __eou__
I cant see Devices but there is Places on the left __eou__ here : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1383231/ __eou__
so i wont probably need to install drivers , just get good xorg . conf settings and it should work ? __eou__
i know .. but my wired network is an inner one in the household , which i use for local services . __eou__
search all of dconf for datetime then __eou__
yeah __eou__
Right , we can provided you are running Ubuntu __eou__ You should really know better then to be asking non ubuntu related support questions in #ubuntu . __eou__
tried that - will do so again __eou__

i don't know ... __eou__

Debian has an xfce version and lxde if i recall correctly . __eou__
you can check online if the system has a make and model __eou__ or if you grab a live CD / USB , you can run : cat /proc/cpuinfo and see the CPU , then look online , see what it can do __eou__ If the system is even vaguely new , it'll probably be 64bit :) __eou__ add the playdeb PPA and you ca install lots of games there __eou__ http://archive.getdeb.net/install_deb/playdeb_0.3-1~getdeb1_all.deb install that and then go crazy at : http://www.playdeb.net/updates/ubuntu/12.10/ __eou__

this may seem of topic but stay with me , i dont use gnome , i use kde , dolphin is the file browser ( think nautilus) , with it i can access some server via ssh(already is setup with sshd ) to either server it up via sftp or fish , the point is that it looks seemless on my end , just another folder to access , i would think that nautilus is as capable via perhaps a plugin/script , samba is a mess in my opinion __eou__
i think 3d is not possible . but i didnt need it recently so maybe my view is outdated . i would stick to 2d unity __eou__
Please watch your language . Can you make a copy of the image so that we can experiment without risking the data ? __eou__
ok thank you any way __eou__
i dont know that much about gvfs . but i know that the nautilus is using it for the samba shares __eou__ ! away > stijnaway __eou__

Yes , installed and running . __eou__ No probs :) __eou__
Then it 's your router config that needs correcting . __eou__ Try logging into the router 's outside IP . __eou__ What kind of router is it ? __eou__ You would have to log into your router and see what it 's outside IP is . __eou__

there was a program called EasyBCD that was specifically designed to correct this , but it doesn't work for me . I swear I have the worst of luck when it comes to technology . I'm not even technologically challenged either __eou__
ideally you'd forward some ports from the outside world to your desktop machine , but you'd need to check the bittorrent and router documentation for that __eou__ other clients will want to connect to your client , which means running a server of sorts __eou__

that didnt work __eou__ i did sudo dpkg -- set-selections < packages . txt __eou__ and packages . txt is a text file with the output of the other system __eou__ was that wrong ? __eou__
than the people that told you it could be screen or hardware are most likely correct __eou__
does it appear at startup ? is it activated in BIOS setup ? __eou__

Yes . __eou__

Will do .... thanks ! __eou__
http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8828047&postcount=15 you can look at this solution for #2 . __eou__
huh , but I can't ping out . __eou__ maybe . maybe flush IPTables __eou__
I wish I knew , but you can try searching the wine database ( cant remember the site ) to see if others had any luck with it . __eou__
most easiest way is VB , isn't ? VB can work like sandbox .. right ? __eou__

you're exactly right . but even when i open it using " nano /etc/wpa_supplicant . conf " i still get " Permission Denied " __eou__
sorry , i meant " service " not " server ". __eou__ ! anyone | sambagirl __eou__ I would have imagined packet forwarding/masquerading to just work nowadays . __eou__ anyway **unknown** , these are the keywords to search for . It involves a tiny bit of iptables . Not too hard . __eou__
i mean smth like a " | " between icons __eou__
and the equivelant for grub2 __eou__
not an option , but thanks __eou__
you need to first understand which part of grub is failing , then fix that part so that the grub . conf is correctly generated __eou__ you do not edit hte grub config directly as it will be overwritten when updates come in a trigger the dynamic update of the config __eou__
im ure it is released , ubuntu is open source .... __eou__ why not update then , 10.10 is ancient ;-p __eou__ so you would rather jerry-rig something to work and spend tons of time doing so and maybe not succeed insted of doing a simple upgrade ? __eou__
tell me your opinion . __eou__
oh so this is a script that corrects human errors nice __eou__ . /configure ; make ; make test ; make install __eou__
thank you __eou__
you'd probably have to make a script , my gthumb script has : # ! /bin/sh export LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 ; gthumb " $@ "; __eou__ then you can run that script in the . desktop file __eou__

i also use ubuntu __eou__
You don't NEED to disable the root account , I'm just saying it offers al ot more added security __eou__ Because by disableing root you close a lot of potential vulnerabilities . __eou__
yup __eou__
mmh .. not compatible __eou__
if you dont like it do it yourself or use andother distro . but the ubuntu way stays the ubuntu way __eou__
cheers __eou__

then EasyBCD must not be working properly . honestly this is more of a question for #windows or something . you just need to run fixmbr or whatever the windows command is to install their bootloader __eou__ but grub doesn't do anything special to protect itself . its in the mbr/pbr as you instructed it to be __eou__
unitialized variable . pretty typical . do be more careful next time . __eou__

ok __eou__
and what the netmask for it ? __eou__
turn off the vm , make sure you configure it to boot a livecd and turn it back on , it should boot the cd rather than your vm 's harddisk __eou__
too complicated for me __eou__
same error again __eou__
yes ... it seems it work __eou__
one of that cards has in ' Port ' settings listed ' **unknown** Pair ' and another one in ' Port : MII ' does it matter ? __eou__

i am not a specialist but i have heard of this error before . google the specific error . __eou__ you probably will find the cause __eou__
normal vanilla install yes __eou__

just wondering how you would " see me " in a few __eou__
Ok , there they're Hm at least the gnome themes . __eou__
I think it uses the swap partition though , so you might need different swap partitions __eou__ I have no idea if the feature is exposed by default anymore , check the menu where you power off __eou__
at least where I am it is down __eou__ thanks . quite **unknown** __eou__
no problem , I should check that in software center ? __eou__
in any case , you are using the right tool , reasonably so anyways . This has now escaped the topic of this channel . I recommend asking openoffice/libreoffice people __eou__
I will look at the ~/ . xsessions-errors tonight is there anything else that I can look at __eou__
I just opened a real old . xls file in libreoffice calc and it is perfect . __eou__
did you see the pastebin ? __eou__
It should be Excel ? __eou__
folders are all 777 , drives via fstab are " default " for options . __eou__
any way to locate this particular dependency ? __eou__
thanks __eou__
ok thanks .... must be something else then __eou__
so , you probably can't avoid it under the apt-get method __eou__
i have a cd drive its not an issue i just want to create and ultimate portable install __eou__
i would imagine its some apci/power saveing feature thats bugged .. __eou__

welcome ! that was kind of obvious anyway __eou__
not it :) __eou__
Are you considering aborting the fsck ? __eou__
I don't have that directory __eou__
maby that because linux is being ran on the IRC sever __eou__
what exactly did you use to install ubuntu ? __eou__
I am only a bot , please don't think I'm intelligent :) __eou__
my point is this , you dont need to satisfy the TV if the TV accepts a connection from something that does all the transcoding and serves it up to the TV , say ? XBMC , an internal wifi connection is plenty fast enough to stream __eou__ of course __eou__ there is a distro which is specific even , xbmc-buntu __eou__ of course __eou__ it is a server if you want , upnp , __eou__ if you want into the nitty-gritty of xbmc check out #xbmc __eou__

you start a private chat with chanserv and do the proper commands to it . __eou__ little hard to install stuff with no networking . ;) __eou__ cable would make it a lot easier .. __eou__ then you could just do a ' sudo dhclient eth0 ' i belive to get networking going . __eou__ then use that reinstall command __eou__

doesn't really solve the problem though , since i LOVE unity . __eou__
its not advised and can break things __eou__
1.60 rc would be my choice , maybe minimec can help you build ? __eou__
do you know how i could get a ppa for precise to work on quantal ? __eou__
i only installed linux for this one project __eou__
good , thanks :) __eou__ i don't care as much that it is broken , i care more if i have no way to solve it . __eou__
**unknown** , I am finding the unity indicator support is somewhat broken for xchat and xchat-gnome , does it work for irssi and pidgin ? __eou__
-18 is the one currently used by ubuntu __eou__

ty __eou__
i guess everything is in the paste , it 's cisco anyconnect client for ubuntu and ssl cert issue __eou__
NetworkManager should be able to do it __eou__

it is working now ? __eou__ hmm not good __eou__
sudo chown 777 /dev/sda is that right ? __eou__ why are you using ftp anyway ? __eou__
rename ' s/ **unknown** ' * does not work here __eou__
now , because FTP freaks out when I try to connect __eou__
thanks for the suggestion but it does not work __eou__
what video chip do you use ? __eou__
boom __eou__ so over your ssh connection , you now have the source dir mounted as a local filesystem __eou__ ah __eou__

there might be a netinstall version also __eou__ else just get the server version and install the desktop __eou__
the command `groups` not the file /etc/groups __eou__ the useradd command didnt work __eou__ `groups` gives the runtime group membership so until that includes www-data __eou__
The entire output of the command you ran that caused that message . __eou__
thanks , my version number was messed up __eou__
woops ? __eou__
Damn , does the windows installer really do that thorough a job ? Oh well , nothing to do then , I guess ... :( __eou__
well rsync keeps saying it is skipping the directory __eou__
First please pastebin the output of " dmesg " ( Open a terminal , run " dmesg ", then copy and paste the output to http://pastebin.ubuntu.com and post the link to the output here) . __eou__
what 's the difference ? __eou__
yes exactly only i dont know which one it is __eou__
honestly , it sounds like some kind of malware infection to me ... but if there 's no plain text matches in grep , and the URL has been encoded somehow , auditing by hand is just about the only way __eou__
no no the rhythm , the ripple , don't believe the hype ! __eou__

you will learn , stop samba > sudo service smbd stop __eou__
thanks __eou__
i don't understand what you mean ? __eou__ the guest session is just that , for someone to sit and use your computer as a one-off ... if it 's your computer , you should have your own account on it , and files saved in that home directory ( i.e. **unknown** ) don't get deleted on logout __eou__
not a proper response , my windows machine does 2 gigs way faster __eou__
it booted __eou__
and that enviroment variables can cause more damage __eou__
in my opinion , this UEFI stuff is enough for MS to be fined for anticompetitiveness __eou__
thanks . Do they both support UEFI ? __eou__
ok , that is way above my pay grade __eou__
make sure you've got it plugged into your PC directly , not through a hub __eou__
thanks , but not possible __eou__
putting the whole thing in parenthesis is the same as having it without them __eou__

yeah , a world map would be nice __eou__

go get bash lessons on #bash ! __eou__ have a nice day __eou__
before running the actual " cp " command , construct it using " ls " in order to see what it 's going to select before you do any copying __eou__
not as sexy as bashing i know , but it works , the first time ! __eou__ less you forgot , the point of ubuntu is ' relative ease ' __eou__ he wants to reboot ! __eou__

I was pretty sure you can only have 1 default gateway , hence the term ' default ' lol __eou__
plz help __eou__
I got ya , it should work because Ubuntu has the /etc/update-alternatives present(I think that takes care of the majority of the prior flash squabbles on linux/ubuntu ) __eou__
so your saying that it could be a software compatibility thing ? The plugins were compatible , maybe I should check the about : config , and see the plugin settings/etc ... __eou__
ok then im out of clues for ya ,, call the admin and have him give it to ya ;) __eou__
i belive ive seen some .. ages ago .. not really used them __eou__
no probs __eou__ think is just called software-center __eou__
don't want commercials of any kind __eou__

thats not all of it __eou__
yea but still safer then most __eou__

I'm using Debian right now . Is it that different ? __eou__ And do you use gnome shell , or just gnome 2 ? :) Is there an option besides gnome shell and unity ? __eou__
I'm sure it 's software . __eou__
then you can try foremost . You will need a partition as big as the partition to spit all the data to ( deleted and current) . The data may be damaged or it may be fine __eou__
i installed some updates including moving from grub 1.5 to grub 2 now i get error 15 on bootup __eou__ i can mount my linux partition after booting from the **unknown** __eou__ is there any file i need to edit or do i need to re-run grub-install ? __eou__ i don't know why this failed in the first place __eou__

you just want to make trouble ? i just said you shouldnt assume the not-ubuntu-way in a ubuntu-support __eou__ and if the user runs SULinux and cant use sudo and stuff , why the heck is he not asking in their support ? so stop being that way __eou__
didn't know that was a thing - sorry !!! don't hate me !! __eou__
Chrome contains proprietary code which you can't examine , I suggest running wireshark while using it __eou__
at the top where it shows a add on card icon it should give you options for additional drivers __eou__
Can't find the chrome edition of those dbg symbols __eou__
i guess you can put a script to run at startup that writes how many times it has run to disk somewhere ... __eou__
I'd assume it 's related to the way that particular usb is formatted __eou__

I'll cover that support , haha __eou__ AwesomeWM is in the default repo for 12.10 __eou__ Oh , I was just joking that I'll cover that support as I don't use any other DEs other than Cinnamon and Awesome :) __eou__
apparently so .. __eou__
Ctrl+Alt+F1 will switch you over to commandline __eou__ it wotn shut X off __eou__

I assume you are the admin on the box , why don't you set it up for them ? __eou__

Unity crashed while installing 12.10 from 12.04 , so I had to reboot . It now hangs at boot without giving an error message just after some bootscripts __eou__
I hear you . I'm just giving my opinion after much frustration trying to recover a failed upgrade . __eou__
already in bash __eou__
**unknown** __eou__ now you can tell that your nic is a cool mips processor __eou__

i gave it a try but it doesnt do anything __eou__
is this a laptop or a desktop __eou__
the application software for take control of my modem __eou__
that 's not really an ubuntu issue , that depends on the router __eou__
wasn't aware of those __eou__ the pi does everything I need __eou__
i know but i think its a general problem wich can besolved it hasn`t anything todo with my architecture __eou__
So at a point where someohow the number of available ports was used concurrently , somehow , the server would just end up queueing the request till it 's got available ports ? __eou__ makes sense __eou__ I'm just trying to get the bigger picture I guess __eou__ right , I just figured in the case of someone like google , that there had to be situations where the ports would get used up , but I guess where its not all the same network and there 's more than a single server , this would remedy that , as well as simply queueing the people up __eou__ for the destination ( from the client perspective ) but when the server replies , it 's not using that port anymore , it uses the original port the request was sent From the client on ? __eou__ one other question after this __eou__
pretty much yes . but it only uses one port , port 80 . every port has a common useage and generally everyone respects the purpose of those ports __eou__
thank you __eou__
oh beautiful ... let me try __eou__ Everything is working well now . Thanks for the tip . __eou__
question was what port firefox uses to establish a **unknown** . and that is a port > 1024 to destination : 80 period __eou__ and btw , you are talking about port-forwarding , which is a different thing as general tcp connection-establishment __eou__
Just making sure I'm not doing anything that ubuntu/linux would dislike . __eou__
dmesg reported some ATA read errors . but that was a one time thing , almost a month ago . What I'm not sure about now is , should I replace the disk ( which will cost me a lot since it 's a dedicated server hosted by a company ) or are the errors kind of fixed **unknown** __eou__ the RAID has done a complete rebuild since the read errors . does that mean I'm out of danger or am I just prolonging the inevitable ? __eou__
**unknown** , crimsonmane , but shouldn't aspell at least behave properly ? It used to ... until a few months ago . Now it insists that all my Z 's become S 's and that I speak in Queen 's English . This is utter rubbish ! ( Indeed ) __eou__
I mean , what app would I use to create the deb from the src files ? __eou__ Alright , you suggest checkinstall as well . __eou__
no it uses kde , xcfe but you can install the base http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/Documentation:Ubuntu:Upgrade < -- full gruide __eou__
which part ? __eou__
that is odd .. id remove the account and change the ssh passwd __eou__
mmm i was reading on help.ubuntu.com about ssh rules which led to **unknown** and before doing anything i just want to backup files im about to change __eou__ =) __eou__ so by doing that i can make several backups for example right now iptables are " virgin " unchanged i can iptables-save **unknown** . dat and after some changes do iptables-save **unknown** . dat and still revert to number1 ? __eou__
logged in today and yesterday , from an AOL address __eou__
so should I just remove it ? __eou__
Yes . __eou__ If you manually added it to sources . list then remove it that way . If you added it by doing add-apt-repository then remove it 's entry from /etc/apt/sources . list . **unknown** directory __eou__
stop being a dick __eou__
Very good . __eou__

this may help you > https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/advanced-installation.html#lvm __eou__
I think I even link to it from my blog post __eou__
mgedmin OerHeks I know . thanks . I just was desperately searching the additional drivers thing in gnome-shell __eou__
i forgot my password ikonia __eou__ yes phy1729 __eou__ i thought about reinstalling ubuntu __eou__ but i dont have a dvd drive __eou__ shoot __eou__

thank you :) __eou__
thanks , ill try that tonight . __eou__
no idea , sorry :( __eou__
stop nagging me like a coked up wife ^3^ __eou__
roger that ty =) __eou__
Oh , that may be __eou__ Edit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal __eou__ something like this'll do the trick : sudo sed -i ' **unknown** ' /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades __eou__ Sure , use vim or whatever , just sometimes you need to do stuff in a non-interactive manner __eou__ So gave that to you if that was the case __eou__
No , again , if the advice I gave for 12.10 doesn't work out , go to #ubuntu+1 . I know nothing about 13.04 __eou__
thats for #ubuntu-offtopic . this is support ONLY . __eou__
Well , the only thing Ajenti has by default is a thing to install plugins . __eou__
smart guy .. __eou__
yeah because it is installed and the canadate can not install due to **unknown** jamble libs __eou__ there is something called a **unknown** file in this file we list all packages that are need for program to either build and install if it was calling for some lib that was debian only then there could be troubles . or if version is not correct in Ubuntu repos but debian repo has it . see what I am saying ? __eou__
that is cool dr_willi- yeah it just stops the movie when switching workspaces for me wanted to debug it but it is not a big deal __eou__ but at any rate aren't you glad that netflix is now working on Ubuntu . Many many hours can now be wasted faster then before ! =) __eou__ Think about it dr_willi- 6 months ago no netflix no steam and no **unknown** ) no stable armel **unknown** ) now look at this w()()t W(())t more proprietary software in software center = happy bob __eou__
10.10 ... hmm __eou__ yeah but I wouldn't want to __eou__ they are not geeks and it 's taken them ages to put stuff in menus __eou__ 11.10 maybe ... I just don't want to make it so different .. also being such a slow computer ... __eou__ so you don't recommend upgrading to 10.10 or 11.10 ? __eou__
that 's why , kill the proceses off __eou__ if you pastenin the output of the command , I can advise __eou__
there is a couple of ways ti do that . onw would be to run do-release-upgrade other would be to change the code name in all the repos __eou__
thanks __eou__
I was a noob ( and still am ) and didn't know the difference really __eou__
is it that one of the dependant debs was installed from other than ubuntu repos ? __eou__
u see am using 12.04 and i want to know if there is any update __eou__
I did xforwarding too , but Xnest is much faster over trusted network __eou__
okay will try vncserver __eou__ but the defaults should atleast work __eou__
Thanks __eou__
cool __eou__
Interesting , the issue only occurs on programs listed as technical items . __eou__
: just type it in dash __eou__
oki __eou__ trimkind of hidden .. __eou__
I am sorry but I am not the best person for that . I am sure that others will come along though . (cant $$ more monitors ) __eou__
ah well .... i thought it was just your , achine that you'd managed to break ... in which case search on __eou__
precise pangolin is version 12.04 __eou__
I tried the boot-repair app but it didn't make any difference __eou__
good to know __eou__
heh , well they were right about Steam on Linux about 18 months later :) __eou__ which by the way , Steam on linux is impressive . even their openGL " Big Picture Mode " works __eou__
try the replace command . metacity -- replace or icewm -- replace with whatever other WM you have installed __eou__
so you're saying I can't use a custom cursor and still have ctrl a work ? __eou__
I got like 10 sec bootups to the lightdm login screen ,,, ;) __eou__ ive no idea what you want in the fstab or what you are trying to do .. that line puts my /tmp/ in ram . i have 8gb of ram __eou__ i doubt if that affects boot time much . ;) __eou__
I need to switch back to Unity from cli after starting some different gui __eou__ an advice ? __eou__
no idea , all I know is that when I start Thunderbird it almost immediately uses all RAM and swap it can get its hands on , and hammers seven bloody bells out of my IMAP seriver __eou__ I've given up on Thunderbird __eou__ it 's been pretty much useless since they started the tabs nonsense __eou__
yeah I know , but I also know you can run them offline without going to the website , I'm trying to find something that will do this __eou__
And at least two people told you and him that he is wrong , already . __eou__
okay ! :) I speak english but just by computer usage so not very extended . Prefer my mother language for more discuss ! :p __eou__
thanks :D __eou__
i don't care , i don't use it __eou__
Thanks . I'll look there . __eou__
indeed , didn't see anything __eou__
ty , i did the space bar and it seems to have worked __eou__
thank you .. __eou__
Which , thanks to Unity is easier to use , snappier , and more intuitive than Vista , which doesn't have a bad UI , really , more secure and stable , handles resources better , and free . __eou__ Plus their OS is five years old , mine is still new . __eou__ Also , a tad curious about 13.04 too . __eou__
I tried the boot-repair app but it didn't make any difference __eou__ It 's on the same drive , two different partitions , the second drive is just storage __eou__
i just use the normal mount commands . Every usb adaptor ive seen - never needed any extra drivers __eou__
glade to hear that . TeamRockey1233c you have played with previews and what not ? again that is great that you like Unity I also Love Unity , was more of a 2d kida dude but I am learning to code for 3d now and It is fun . have a good one and let us know if you have any questions about unity , i __eou__
I dunno if my system is on autologin or it freezes before login .. __eou__
Yes , just like on the page you linked to us . __eou__
thats the command .. ; __eou__
it freezes when starting the current default __eou__
i don't see any horror stories __eou__
I know I have SATA , but your netbook should too . __eou__
yea like ages ago __eou__
from the normal ubuntu-repos you will not get ff16 __eou__ the repos are onyl holding the latest version , normally there are not two versions of a program ( some exceptions like samba , python and so on ) __eou__ is there a special reason why you need ff16 ? __eou__
;) __eou__
k , if that fails , will try a reboot __eou__
**unknown** : Why keep track of updates for something I don't seem to use or need ? It 's just a waste of space , if it 's not necessary . I try to keep my server as minimal as possible . __eou__ **unknown** __eou__
maybe hit F11 ? __eou__
yeah , applies to Gnome Shell , and Docky is by default at the bottom . __eou__
but my job forces me to use completely windows b/c i manage windows server and pcs :( __eou__ i know but still __eou__ why would you want to disable ? __eou__
Should work though . __eou__
windows works fine in a virtual machine in virtualbox for me . __eou__
is it better then wine ? Do you play games this way ? __eou__
as a ubuntu user , I am looking for ways to make ubuntu better for me . I feel that this coversation isnt too outside the realms of the channel __eou__
Nobody is going to be more helpful than me in your case . Please use ##linux for general linux support __eou__
but I'm asking for an experienced opinion __eou__
for minix development , yes . But can we move off this topic ? __eou__
i read some of it it was hard to follow __eou__
because it is written on top of mach __eou__
offical **unknown** . Stop it now . I'm being polite . Can you respect the purposes of this channel please ? __eou__ thank you __eou__ I somehow doubt this is a genuine request from you after your talk about minix , but here : http://www.ubuntu.com/community/get-involved __eou__
wouldn't that mean you have to modify the install media to avoid the repos ? __eou__
but it says " DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN " __eou__
thanks __eou__ could you give me an example of the command I would pass to mencoder , this is one of the longest manpages i've seen __eou__
thanks __eou__
just found a 64 bit . deb of ndisgtk I'll try that __eou__ glad I found it __eou__
check the cups server settings . there may be some security to resctict configuration to localhost . __eou__
try ##linux __eou__
#bash dead ? Its one of the most active channels I've ever seen .. most questions are answered in less than a minute . But feel free to ask here too __eou__
nope , a local printer through usb __eou__
Thanks that looks perfect __eou__
theres some setting to set static ip . or everything static . i just set them all .. or i set my routers dns servers to those instaed of letting it get them from m y isp .. it then gives them to the rest of the lan __eou__
ask him , I have no idea . Apperantely he wants -i to be -a ( for " ask ", I suppose __eou__ and he made a 56-line script that apparently does the same as rm -r with or without -i __eou__
I don't use PPAs for PHP as I have production machines on 5.3 , so I stay the same __eou__
np . dr_willis : if there 's a good FLOSS driver for this ATI Radeon that'll give me decent 3D hardware-accelleration , I'd be happy to give that a try . got pointers , please ? __eou__
i did that and still no joy __eou__
I'm okay creating my own ppa to add to the software sources for now , it could qualify to get into ubuntu 's default repo eventually but I'd like to start somewhere __eou__
i got 210 pkgs that depend on it __eou__ any1 on 12.10 can install bluez ( bluetooth support ) and tell me what version of python they are running ? __eou__ anyone here is using bluetooth on 12.10 ? __eou__
ok , thanks __eou__
Checking . __eou__ Right - similar to what I found . Just force apt to re-read all package lists . Thanks for your help :) __eou__
np __eou__
ok .. let say i login to a cisco device using ssh , den i run show run . i want to capture what ever that show in there __eou__ hmm .. i think screen can do that .. __eou__
i could be proved wrong , i would appreciate that , i am facing the same dilema sort of __eou__
no reason , no __eou__
: i know that this way i will get source but how do i know how many packages or what packages i need to compile as a standard ubuntu distro __eou__
yeah , guess 3.7 is for raring __eou__ what 's the output of lsb_release -sd ? __eou__
msot liekly it is a desktop mobo even __eou__
could maybe use teh vlc web ui __eou__
< 3 __eou__
llutz , thank you __eou__
i actually use ubuntu __eou__
the urls are mixed with surrounded text , its rss i think __eou__
done that , doesn't work __eou__
have you tried a different USB stick ? __eou__ have you tried the device in a different PC ? __eou__ yes , use FAT32 __eou__ ask in #arch __eou__
i ping the server its responding . but still unable to connect to the network __eou__
nope __eou__
booting CD/DVD is a different process than booting a HD partition __eou__ nice , good to know it 's smart enough to work that way :) __eou__
i will try __eou__ tnx __eou__
ikonia and I are just discussing that __eou__ even , sorry **unknown** , tab complete fail __eou__
yes , it might help . I cant remember if it can recover any files __eou__
yep , that 's what I thought __eou__
Hi , I can see its detected and I tried that command but it asked for proper filesystem . I ran blkid and then gparted to get proper filesystem but it didn't help __eou__
**unknown** __eou__
i guess i will have the same problem in ubuntu , but team fortress 2 crashes :) __eou__
if you use apt-get it should work ok . aptitude doesn't play taht way __eou__
yes , all permissions have been set __eou__ about the extension : It 's so I myself know it 's a bash script __eou__
zykes- : Thanks for the info __eou__ Thanks __eou__
the default repos ? I purged the PPAs I had __eou__
Thanks __eou__
I am aware of some **unknown** drivers and 64bit issues etc . But as for stability , I should expect about the same experience as in 32bit ? Okay , thanks . __eou__
yep __eou__
to fix partial updates __eou__
